VO_Clukay_Series_Battle_Start.wav
  Are you scared?

VO_Clukay_Series_Chosen.wav
  It's because of training.

VO_Clukay_Series_Chosen_Auto.wav
  It's no big deal.

VO_Clukay_Series_Daily_001.wav
  What are you doing? I think you can tell by looking at me. I have a lot to do as the captain of the preponderance, preparation for the request, and pre-investigation of the materials for the fee application. I don't have a reliable assistant like Groza or Mary.

VO_Clukay_Series_Daily_002.wav
  After Andris came, the mucity's habit of skipping the loop became terrible. Commander, is there any good way to educate him?

VO_Clukay_Series_Daily_003.wav
  I've been observing you until now, but my team management philosophy is different from Groza and Riva. Well, I can't say that 404 is the best.

VO_Clukay_Series_Daily_004.wav
  Are all the current bike designers part-time jobs? All the cars that have been announced this year are good in terms of specs, and the design is not a piece of the essence. I say that there is supply because there is demand, but there is only a sigh that there are people who buy such a thing.

VO_Clukay_Series_Daily_005.wav
  Low-pollution pillows, coffee siphons, and summer blankets? Haa... They're buying unnecessary things again because I don't like them...

VO_Clukay_Series_Daily_006.wav
  I realized after I threw away the useless hesitation I had held back in the past. I'm the only one who can pull 404. The future of 404 will be the proof that I can be perfect.

VO_Clukay_Series_Daily_007.wav
  The weak are not needed in 404. Even if they don't want it, I'll make them the strongest combat dolls.

VO_Clukay_Series_Daily_008.wav
  Seriously, how can I raise those Bonkura to become elite dolls?

VO_Clukay_Series_Daily_009.wav
  It was a surprising harvest, but as I was using it on missions, I gradually started to like large bikes.

VO_Clukay_Series_Daily_010.wav
  I finally lost to Bioka. She always follows me around and when I'm annoying, she's not there. There's no one as naive as her in the orbit base, right?

VO_Clukay_Series_Hit.wav
  I love you.

VO_Clukay_Series_Hitted_5.wav
  Thank you for watching!

VO_Clukay_Series_Kill.wav
  Target silent.

VO_Clukay_Series_Lose.wav
  ... equal export范... It's an indecision... autor sharper, right? if this is one of her kind reports then i will tell on her she was looking down on me

VO_Clukay_Series_Set_Click.wav
  Actions begin!

VO_Clukay_Series_Set_Fall.wav
  Attention!

VO_Clukay_Series_Shield_Broken.wav
  Damn it!

VO_Clukay_Series_Skill01.wav
  Learn the reality!

VO_Clukay_Series_Skill02.wav
  I'll give you a hand.

VO_Clukay_Series_Tone_Positive_003.wav
  Continue.

VO_Clukay_Series_Tone_Positive_004.wav
  Not bad.

VO_Clukay_Series_Tone_Positive_009.wav
  What can I say...

VO_Clukay_Series_Tone_Positive_010.wav
  Give up.

VO_Clukay_Series_Ultimate.wav
  If you're going to give up, then do it now.

VO_Clukay_Series_Up_002.wav
  Not bad.

VO_Clukay_Series_Up_004.wav
  It's not enough yet.

VO_Clukay_Series_Up_005.wav
  I need to add more training.

VO_Clukay_Series_Up_006.wav
  Not yet.

VO_Clukay_Series_Win.wav
  Fufu, I'm lucky to have turned 404 into an enemy.

VO_Clukay_Single_Acquire_R_001.wav
  It's true that it's been a year since we met, but I don't think it's something to celebrate. Let's celebrate even when it's the fifth year. This is a mission, so failure is not allowed.

VO_Clukay_Single_Acquire_SR_001.wav
  It's been a year since we've been in a partnership. It's about time we got through the meeting, right? From now on, we'll be more strict. Commander, please do your best to stay with me.

VO_Clukay_Single_Acquire_SSR_001.wav
  It's been a year since then. When I'm with you, I feel like time goes by so fast. I guess that's why you're the same no matter how many years pass.

VO_Clukay_Single_Anniversary_001.wav
  In this year, we have established a good relationship. In the nature of 404, even if the position of the commander changes, it will not be a

VO_Clukay_Single_Birthday_R_001.wav
  Happy birthday. What's with that smile? I'll tell you, but please don't relax because it's your birthday.

VO_Clukay_Single_Birthday_SR_001.wav
  Happy birthday. Please maintain a good relationship this year. ...No way. There are many organizations that want to establish a cooperative relationship with 404. The Commander is a blessed person.

VO_Clukay_Single_Birthday_SSR_001.wav
  Commander, I left something in the break room. What? It's a birthday present. Did you think it was a request? Wait, no! Not now! I'll see it when I'm away.

VO_Clukay_Single_Birthday_SSR_002.wav
  Today was a special day, right? Here, this. Eh? You don't have a heart? Ah... Commander, today is your birthday. Is there anything else special?

VO_Clukay_Single_Children_001.wav
  The balloon Misty and Bioka had, did you give it to them? Haa, you're not a child, so you're not going to be a good commander... Eh? I have a part in it too... Th-That kind of child-slaughtering toy... W-Well, it might be just right for decorating the room...

VO_Clukay_Single_Christmas_001.wav
  Commander, would you like me to decorate this candy cane on the tree? A little more to the left... Yes, yes, that's fine. And... this... Ah, that's something you don't need to decorate. I prepared it in excess... It's a top star. Merry Christmas.

VO_Clukay_Single_Christmas_002.wav
  Merry Christmas, Commander. Is this it? This is... It's called Gingerbread Man, and it was made by Andrés and a beautician... I-I also made it myself. Yes. I made it just like you. Shall we eat it?

VO_Clukay_Single_Duanwu_001.wav
  ... Tie this tight... Alright, now it's a square triangle. Hm? Can I make the shape of the bloodstain more freely? As an elite doll, I don't intend to accept such a good job. The bloodstain in your hand too. Here, I'll fix the shape, so please give it to me quickly.

VO_Clukay_Single_Friendliness_001.wav
  I still have work to do, so please do as you please, Commander.

VO_Clukay_Single_Friendliness_002.wav
  I'm currently drawing a design draft of the bike's custom design, but are you familiar with the bike?

VO_Clukay_Single_Friendliness_003.wav
  Commander, if possible, would you like to introduce your familiar dark blocker? The 404's purchase route is unstable recently, so I will definitely return this loan.

VO_Clukay_Single_Friendliness_004.wav
  I've been seeing old friends lately, and they all said I've changed. Do you think so, Commander?

VO_Clukay_Single_Friendliness_005.wav
  Commander, you were looking at our mock training earlier. How is the 404's ability?

VO_Clukay_Single_Friendliness_006.wav
  Groza, Nemesis, they're all excellent dolls. Yes, as you can imagine, we're calculating the amount of money for the Elmo. Of course, it's not a waste of time to hire a commander who's lost his way.

VO_Clukay_Single_Friendliness_007.wav
  Commander, would you like to go for a drive? I got something good from the previous mission and I put it on my bike, so I want to try it right away.

VO_Clukay_Single_Friendliness_008.wav
  HKM4, 416, and KURUKAI. The only thing that has changed is not just the name. I once made a distinction in the past, but now it doesn't matter anymore. You understand this feeling, right? Commander.

VO_Clukay_Single_Friendliness_009.wav
  Commander, you came to the right place. For the next request, you need to wear a suit, so if possible, you can decide on your own. It's just a job, so don't imagine anything strange.

VO_Clukay_Single_Friendliness_010.wav
  What is this? Reward? Commander, 404 and I are not that cheap. You still don't understand? This time I just wanted to help. I don't need that kind of money.

VO_Clukay_Single_Friendliness_011.wav
  Welcome back. Um, why are you looking at me like an idiot? Eh? Were you laughing? Me? You-you must be mistaken. You've gotten a little blind, Commander.

VO_Clukay_Single_Friendliness_012.wav
  Now, would you mind not talking about your request? Please let me rest for a bit. I feel somewhat at ease in front of you, Commander. Well, it's not bad.

VO_Clukay_Single_Friendliness_013.wav
  You're looking at another doll again... Is it really that good? Well, I'll find out who's the best for you later.

VO_Clukay_Single_Login_001.wav
  You're late. I've been waiting.

VO_Clukay_Single_MidAutumn_001.wav
  Andris said today is a day of chaos, so Bioka is trying to party at 404. Haa, they're going to be a pain in the ass again, so how about the commander?

VO_Clukay_Single_MidAutumn_002.wav
  Commander, you saw the message I sent, right? Because they ordered a huge mooncake, we had no choice but to eat it together. Everyone is waiting for you. Me? Of course I was waiting for you too. I'm already used to waiting for you, Commander.

VO_Clukay_Single_NewYear_001.wav
  Commander, when did you get there? I'm working on a plan for next year. It's a secret of 404, so don't try to erase it... Eh? You saw my name? That's because you're an important collaborator of 404, so it's natural that your name is on it.

VO_Clukay_Single_NewYear_002.wav
  Thank you for your help last year, Commander. Let's cooperate more closely this year. Of course, there is no exemption.

VO_Clukay_Single_Obon_001.wav
  Obon... There's no one to hurt, and it's a holiday that I don't really feel. And, rather than drowning in the past, it's better to protect what you have now, so you won't regret it later, right?

VO_Clukay_Single_Obtain_SSR_001.wav
  I'm the head of the 404th Gen, the elite doll Kuru. It's been a while, Commander.

VO_Clukay_Single_Passive_SSR_001.wav
  Beware of surroundings

VO_Clukay_Single_SpringFes_001.wav
  Commander, I'm writing a Tsuiren right now, but according to Meirin, it's best to use the same number of letters and vowels in the paper and the letter of the letter and add the meaning of blessing. If you divide the code name of the 404 members, it's exactly the same number of letters, so you can also put the year of the gold... What are you laughing at? Nothing is wrong, right?

VO_Clukay_Single_SpringFes_002.wav
  Happy New Year, Commander. What was I doing? I was just making a paper cutout to decorate the window, but... The time it takes is because I'm pursuing perfection. W-Wait, those failure plans are something I plan to throw away later! Please don't look!

VO_Clukay_Single_ThanksGiving_001.wav
  What a troublesome holiday. There are a lot of thanks from companies that have been in contact with 404 since morning. The text looks like a one-off message, and I don't feel any sincerity at all. Eh? You want to thank me? You mean the Commander? We're not that hard on you...

VO_Clukay_Single_Title_001.wav
  Dolls Front Line 2 Exilium

VO_Clukay_Single_Valentine_001.wav
  Here, chocolate. Of course it's handmade. You can tell by that, right? The way it's wrapped is so good that it looks like it's on the market? Huh... You've gotten so much that you can tell, Commander.

VO_Clukay_Single_Valentine_002.wav
  Yes, Commander. This is my chocolate. Yes, the taste and shape are perfect. The volume has also increased considerably, so I will probably not eat any other chocolates today. Then, please ride my bike next time. I will take you to a good place.

VO_Clukay_Single_WhiteVale_001.wav
  How is Valentine's Day and White Day different? No, I don't want any rewards. Yes, it's to learn human manners. I'm prepared for it, right?
