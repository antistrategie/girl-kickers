VO_Alva_21_VO_Alva_Single_Birthday_SSR_001.wav
  Happy birthday. I wanted to prepare something more special, but... I think this automatic knife is good, Tina. It's okay. I won't open it on my own.

VO_Alva_22_VO_Alva_Single_Christmas_001.wav
  Santa Claus shouldn't exist, but for some reason there's a present under the pillow. Well, you probably left it. I've prepared it too. I'm glad you like it.

VO_Alva_23_VO_Alva_Single_Friendliness_001.wav
  Um... I'm sorry. I'm still a little nervous. It's been 10 years, so I have a lot to talk about.

VO_Alva_24_VO_Alva_Single_Friendliness_002.wav
  If there is something that changes after time, there is something that does not change like us.

VO_Alva_25_VO_Alva_Single_Friendliness_003.wav
  I didn't know you had any connection with the Revenge Squad and Griffin, but... It seems you have something that attracts people and dolls.

VO_Alva_26_VO_Alva_Single_Friendliness_004.wav
  I remember the times. The Frankfurt 10 years ago. I only know two people like you.

VO_Alva_27_VO_Alva_Single_Friendliness_005.wav
  We left the security office, but sometimes we receive work from the security office. We are in a cooperative relationship. After independence, I finally understood why Riva was always in trouble with the capital.

VO_Alva_28_VO_Alva_Single_Friendliness_006.wav
  Why don't you call her by her name? I've learned of her code name and her role as the captain, but... I haven't given her a new name, so I'll leave it to you.

VO_Alva_29_VO_Alva_Single_Friendliness_007.wav
  Sometimes, I imagine that all the battles are over. Opening a bookstore, or hunting cats. If you came to the store, I wouldn't be so happy.

VO_Alva_2_VO_Alva_Series_Daily_002.wav
  The name comes from... Alpha Volk. It's a wolf that leads a flock. She gave it to me.

  Good morning, Commander. I've organized today's schedule.

  Retreat. It's all my fault. I will never repeat the same mistake.

VO_Alva_35_VO_Alva_Single_MidAutumn_001.wav
  Today is a day of chaos. It will be an irreplaceable memory to be able to spend time with you and the people of the Elmo. I wanted to show this view to her.

VO_Alva_36_VO_Alva_Single_NewYear_001.wav
  Happy New Year. I wanted to wear red clothes with you, but you refused. Unexpected? That's right. I forgot about the battle and dreamed of enjoying this kind of event.

VO_Alva_37_VO_Alva_Single_Obtain_SSR_001.wav
  The old AN-94 is no longer here. From now on, as Alba, I will fight for you.

  The Hermo-Go is warmer than I imagined. There's a place for everyone, including me. If I had joined Gryffin instead of the Security Bureau, I wonder if I could have known this feeling earlier.

VO_Alva_40_VO_Alva_Series_Skill02_VO_Alva_Single_Skill_002.wav
  Eliminate the threat!

VO_Alva_41_VO_Alva_Single_SpringFes_001.wav

  I made chocolate with all my gratitude. Please... take it. And this is... medicine. Yes. I made a Voimastina, just in case.

VO_Alva_45_VO_Alva_Series_Win_VO_Alva_Single_Win_001.wav
