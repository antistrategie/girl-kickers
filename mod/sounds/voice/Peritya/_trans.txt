  Be careful!

VO_Peritya_Series_Battle_Start_2.wav
  Goodbye.

VO_Peritya_Series_Battle_Start_3.wav
  I'll delete it.

VO_Peritya_Series_Chosen.wav
  Roger!

VO_Peritya_Series_Chosen_2.wav
  Is that so?

VO_Peritya_Series_Daily_001.wav
  Nice to meet you. Ah, it wasn't the first time?

VO_Peritya_Series_Daily_002.wav
  Today's clouds are in a mysterious shape.

VO_Peritya_Series_Daily_003.wav
  My eyes? Don't worry about it. I won't use it with care.

VO_Peritya_Series_Daily_004.wav
  Caloric... Is it a kind of food that I've heard of somewhere?

VO_Peritya_Series_Daily_005.wav
  Um, what is it? Ah, this strange accessory? Come to think of it, I promised someone something. Hmm? Who was it?

VO_Peritya_Series_Daily_006.wav
  Drawing is fun, isn't it? If you write down things you're about to forget, you'll remember them again. Oh, right! What do you think of my drawing?

VO_Peritya_Series_Daily_007.wav
  That mission is very important. Hm? What was that mission?

VO_Peritya_Series_Daily_008.wav
  All suspicious targets should be eliminated. Of course, it's about this delicious candy.

VO_Peritya_Series_Daily_009.wav
  The beauty of the current delves into everything in this world.

VO_Peritya_Series_Daily_010.wav
  Record important information and erase unnecessary information.

VO_Peritya_Series_Hit.wav
  Now!

VO_Peritya_Series_HittedLast_4.wav
  Not yet!

VO_Peritya_Series_Kill.wav
  Destruction successful!

VO_Peritya_Series_Lose.wav
  Failure... Mission... Overcomplete success... This me... I failed...

VO_Peritya_Series_Skill01.wav
  Repent of your impure actions!

VO_Peritya_Series_Skill02.wav
  You can't avoid it? You'll get hurt.

VO_Peritya_Series_Ultimate.wav
  As you wish.

VO_Peritya_Series_Up_001.wav
  What is this?

VO_Peritya_Series_Up_002.wav
  Thank you very much!

VO_Peritya_Series_Up_003.wav
  This performance is...

VO_Peritya_Series_Up_004.wav
  I'm very grateful.

VO_Peritya_Series_Up_005.wav
  Thank you very much. Have I already thanked you?

VO_Peritya_Series_Up_006.wav
  Yes, I remember.

VO_Peritya_Series_Up_007.wav
  It was a wonderful experience.

VO_Peritya_Series_Up_008.wav
  This feeling... Somehow... It's nostalgic...?

VO_Peritya_Series_Win.wav
  It's a natural result. Unfortunately, you have come this far.

VO_Peritya_Single_Acquire_R_001.wav
  One year is the time the earth orbits the sun. 365 days in a day. It's been a while since I started observing you. But I've never hated it. How many surprises will I be able to enjoy in the future?

VO_Peritya_Single_Acquire_SR_001.wav
  I feel like I've been here for a long time. And I've met something I've never seen before. Gray snow. If I make a snowman with this snow, I'm sure it'll be fun.

VO_Peritya_Single_Acquire_SSR_001.wav
  To celebrate our friendship that has lasted for a year, why don't we celebrate it together according to human manners?

VO_Peritya_Single_Anniversary_001.wav
  Fox ears in the break room, have you noticed? Yes, I thought it would suit you, Commander. Ah, today is a special day, so I should call you.

VO_Peritya_Single_Birthday_R_001.wav
  Happy birthday. Next time, please celebrate me too. Come to think of it, what is a birthday?

VO_Peritya_Single_Birthday_SR_001.wav
  Happy birthday, Commander. I hope you're doing well today.

VO_Peritya_Single_Birthday_SSR_001.wav
  Happy birthday, Commander. You're not going to open it? If it's this present, it's no doubt that it will remain in your memory.

VO_Peritya_Single_Birthday_SSR_002.wav
  Happy birthday. This day was written on every notebook, so it must be a very important day. Hmm? Why did you think it was important?

VO_Peritya_Single_Children_001.wav
  Today is a holiday for children. If you want to get a quiet moment, you don't have to give a lot of toys and sweets. But you must have been quiet when you were little. Like you now.

VO_Peritya_Single_Christmas_001.wav
  Merry Christmas! ...Celebration, huh? People before the war would make a fire in winter, and they would lay on the fluffy carpet and spend it wrapped in blankets. I want to experience something like that with you someday.

VO_Peritya_Single_Christmas_002.wav
  Merry Christmas, Commander! I placed a Christmas tree and socks in the space module. I also put presents for you in the socks. Of course, the contents of the present are data. I hope you will be happy with the data present.

VO_Peritya_Single_Duanwu_001.wav
  There is a special teaching in the word theory that you drink a drink called Yu-O-Shu to prevent diseases. Hmm, I wonder what it tastes like. Would you like to try it?

VO_Peritya_Single_Friendliness_001.wav
  Do you need anything? Are you a conductor? The music is Bierglo気

VO_Peritya_Single_Friendliness_002.wav
  You are the commander, aren't you? Understood. Record storage complete.

VO_Peritya_Single_Friendliness_003.wav
  Don't worry, you're not the target of the mission. For now...

VO_Peritya_Single_Friendliness_004.wav
  This world is pure white, but the hole of horror that was made by being steamed continues. Who is in the hole of horror? Well, it doesn't matter.

VO_Peritya_Single_Friendliness_005.wav
  The collapse storm is a valuable scene to record in your mind. Value... From this word created by humans, I feel a slight intention to push the outside of the meaning.

VO_Peritya_Single_Friendliness_006.wav
  You look happy today. Then, can I try my plan?

VO_Peritya_Single_Friendliness_007.wav
  Even if you're the commander, you're not allowed to touch my accessories.

VO_Peritya_Single_Friendliness_008.wav
  Have you ever observed the world from a higher place? For example, from above the orbit base.

VO_Peritya_Single_Friendliness_009.wav
  Oh, you're injured? Humans can't easily replace parts, so this is a bit troublesome.

VO_Peritya_Single_Friendliness_010.wav
  I heard that humans show more reactions and possibilities when faced with danger. You are still insufficient, as I observed. Yes, I look forward to your actions when faced with danger.

VO_Peritya_Single_Friendliness_011.wav
  If you look at the endless canyon, the quietest place in the Yellow Area is this mobile base where you are. This is a good place to rest.

VO_Peritya_Single_Friendliness_012.wav
  Even in this world of ignorance, I hope your figure will be engraved in this mental forever.

VO_Peritya_Single_Friendliness_013.wav
  If you need to record information, is there any other way to save it other than writing it down in a note or mental? Yes, if you treat your important information as an existence, it will be against human manners.

VO_Peritya_Single_Login_001.wav
  Commander? Hello.

VO_Peritya_Single_MidAutumn_001.wav
  The cake, which is like a round chocolate with a traditional pattern, is a food that can be said to be the epitome of this day. It is called moon-shaped moon cake, and it is filled with wishes of the family. Why do humans want to tie emotions and food together?

VO_Peritya_Single_MidAutumn_002.wav
  Humans have a lot of anniversaries to spend together. No, I don't want to. The moon, being with the commander, It's fun for me.

VO_Peritya_Single_NewYear_001.wav
  Hmm, what is the motive for giving a special meaning to a normal day? Anyway, happy new year!

VO_Peritya_Single_NewYear_002.wav
  It's been a new year again. I don't feel particularly special, but... Oh, right. There was something I could only say today. Happy New Year! Phew... I said it.

VO_Peritya_Single_Obon_001.wav
  Human fantasies are interesting. What cannot be proven by science is interpreted as a fantasy, and we create creatures that do not exist, and we are afraid of them. I want to experience that feeling too. Do you also think that fantasies are scary?

VO_Peritya_Single_Obtain_R_001.wav
  I look forward to your performance. Shiki... Kan...

VO_Peritya_Single_Obtain_SR_001.wav
  I heard your call firmly.

VO_Peritya_Single_Obtain_SSR_001.wav
  You can take a break.

VO_Peritya_Single_SpringFes_001.wav
  It's a pretty lively day. It seems that a doll called Corfen is going to explode from now on. It feels refreshing. I have to turn off the hearing system before turning on the fire.

VO_Peritya_Single_SpringFes_002.wav
  Hmmm.... How about spending time in the fluffy bed and blanket? Ha! No euh! You couldn't sleep because of the sound of the Charge last night... Aaaaaah.... Shall we sleep together, Commander?

VO_Peritya_Single_ThanksGiving_001.wav
  Oh? Today seems to be a very important day. I want to convey my gratitude, not by following the instructions. Thank you for providing me with many valuable observation objects so far.

VO_Peritya_Single_Title_001.wav
  Dolls Front Line 2 Exilium

VO_Peritya_Single_Valentine_001.wav
  Today is a day to convey my feelings to those who care about me and those who love me. I'm sure you'll receive a lot of presents. If you can afford it, please check your communication terminal. There is a message for you hidden in the code.

VO_Peritya_Single_Valentine_002.wav
  It's my first time making it, but it's surprisingly interesting to make chocolate. Commander, I did my best to make it, so I hope you will be happy.

VO_Peritya_Single_WhiteVale_001.wav
  Hm? A cube puzzle pendant? It doesn't seem like a common return on White Day. But it's very beautiful. I was able to decode all the passwords on the previous communication terminal.
