  Ready?

  Let's end this smartly.

Series_Chosen_Auto__VO_Lind_Series_Tone_Positive_007.wav
  What do you want to say?

Series_Chosen__VO_Lind_Series_Tone_Positive_006.wav
  Huh?

Series_Daily_001.wav
  It's not good for the body to take too much sugar, but if you don't take it, your mental will be damaged. Then you should take it. Yeah.

Series_Daily_002.wav
  What are you looking at? I'm not good at playing alone, so ask someone else to play with you.

Series_Daily_003.wav
  Why do I get irritated when I'm a doll and I don't have enough sugar? Ugh... I'll just lick the candy.

Series_Daily_004.wav
  When you're feeling down, you can lick the lollipop. Here.

Series_Daily_005.wav
  There were a lot of rumors about you on the radio last night. Let me hear how true it is.

Series_Die__VO_Lind_Series_Tone_Negative_001.wav
  I don't have enough sugar...

Series_Dying__VO_Lind_Series_Tone_Negative_002.wav
  It can't be true...

Series_Hit__VO_Lind_Single_Hit_001.wav
  I'm serious.

  Yes.

Series_Shield_Broken__VO_Lind_Series_Tone_Negative_003.wav
  How disgusting. Impatient, Koihime saw a moose. I'll end the offer with the moose. All four who didn't take anything for granted run to the 對不對 ... Baby, you're actually lying... So, we 열 Well, Hang ensure that you don't break your word, for once. Agh... ......

Series_Skill01__VO_Lind_Single_Skill_001.wav
  I'll make it easy for you.

Series_Skill02__VO_Lind_Single_Skill_002.wav
  Tch, what a pain.

Series_Tone_Positive_001.wav
  Do you want to fill your body with sugar?

Series_Ultimate__VO_Lind_Single_Ultimate_SSR_001.wav
  Shitt, you won't disappear

Series_Up_001.wav
  Not bad, I guess.

Series_Up_002.wav
  It's good to have a good salary.

Series_Up_003.wav
  What are you expecting?

Series_Up_004.wav
  I'm pretty strong.

Series_Up_005.wav
  Let's get serious.

Series_Win__VO_Lind_Single_Win_001.wav
  By harsh power I could I could visit your heart

Single_Birthday_SSR_001.wav
  This is for you... Uhm... Na- C- Happy birthday... ...I did call you that. Eh- I want answers!

Single_Birthday_SSR_002.wav
  Today's my birthday, right? Then, this... Ugiii, how many presents have you gotten? You can't get any more than that. But... Is mine different from the others? If you say so, then I guess I can't help it.

Single_Christmas_001.wav
  You're kidding, right? Why are you awake? Ohon! I'm Santa Claus, the passing Santa. If I don't go to bed right now, I'll be able to sleep with all my might!

Single_Christmas_002.wav
  Here's your Christmas present. Don't watch too much of the broadcast. I'm not good at that kind of stuff. But... I'm sure you'll like what's inside. W-W-Wait! So, I mean... Do you ever open it in front of me? I-I'm embarrassed, so stop it!

Single_Friendliness_001.wav
  The candy you gave me was sweet.

Single_Friendliness_002.wav
  Why are you doing this to me? You're not thinking of anything strange, are you?

Single_Friendliness_003.wav
  I'll say this first, but I can't speak in a way you'd expect.

Single_Friendliness_004.wav
  You listen to the radio at night? I see... It doesn't mean anything deep, but I think it's good to listen to it.

Single_Friendliness_005.wav
  You should also be careful with your words. Or else, someone like me will come out and make a mistake.

Single_Friendliness_006.wav
  Why didn't you give me the lipstick back last night? Were you sleeping? Ah... If it was that time, then...

Single_Friendliness_007.wav
  I'm dependent on people and things that make me feel good, right? No, it's nothing!

Single_Friendliness_008.wav
  Where are you going? I told you, I have a dependency. I can't live without you.

Single_Login_001.wav
  ... Oh, did you wake up too, Commander?

Single_MidAutumn_001.wav
  I bought a sweet and sweet mooncake. If you're going to appear on the radio where I'm doing personality, I can give you a share, though? Hey, what's with those evil eyes?

Single_MidAutumn_002.wav
  This is the moon viewing? Ah, no, I just thought that every year I would be able to see the moon like this.

Single_NewYear_001.wav
  It's New Year's Eve, so why don't we have a night out together today?

Single_NewYear_002.wav
  I've already prepared snacks and drinks, so when it's 10 o'clock at night, you can come to my room... Hm? It's obvious that we're going to watch the special program at the end of the year! What else is there?

Single_Obtain_SSR_001.wav
  I'm too lazy to introduce myself, so I won't. Name? I'll just go with Rindo.

Single_Passive_SSR_001.wav
  Regeneration complete!

Single_SpringFes_001.wav
  I thought it was just a noisy time of the new year, but this year is not bad. Happy New Year. Come on, open your mouth. This is a special candy. What's with that face? If you want to laugh, do it.

Single_SpringFes_002.wav
  I hope the number of viewers increases, and I hope the Commander becomes more honest. It's weird to pray for New Year's.

Single_Title_001.wav
  Rolls Front Line 2 Exilium

Single_Valentine_001.wav
  Oh, I got so many chocolates. So the rumor is true. Here, this is mine. I added three times the sugar, so I guarantee it's sweet. If you can't eat all the other chocolates, give them to me.

Single_Valentine_002.wav
  Everyone's giving me chocolates, so I have to make one too. Ugh, I haven't done anything big, but I wonder why they're so happy about it.
