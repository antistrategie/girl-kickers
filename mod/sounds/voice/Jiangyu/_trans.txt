  I won't let you get me!

Series_Daily_001.wav
  Commander, I'll listen to Captain Groza, so please increase my duty.

Series_Daily_002.wav
  So this is what the outside world looked like. Let's go on a lot of adventures!

Series_Daily_003.wav
  If you're not with your sister, you don't have to work part-time or practice! This is freedom! Freedom, go!

Series_Daily_004.wav
  I wonder if everyone's been stressed out lately. They're not feeling well at all. Alright! I have to liven up the place!

Series_Daily_005.wav
  Hey, hey, Commander! I just defeated Caloric in the simulation! Isn't that amazing? I want to teach my sister soon!

Series_Daily_006.wav
  Beppu-li is amazing! She never forgets about the live performance even when she's fighting! I want my dancer to do that!

Series_Daily_007.wav
  Don't make that face, Commander. I'm sure you'll be fine.

Series_Daily_008.wav
  Commander, can you tell Nemesis when our band will become popular? Eh? You're being serious. Why are you looking at me like that?

Series_Daily_009.wav
  Even though I only go out for a few days, my sister sends me a lot of messages, such as, don't forget something, don't hesitate, and so on. I'm in trouble if I'm in a relationship.

Series_Daily_010.wav
  I've been to many places with my sister, but the living comfort of the Elmo is exceptional. I don't want to leave here anymore.

  Thank you!

  Onee-chan will be surprised too!

Series_Win__VO_Jiangyu_Single_Win_001.wav
  I told you, right? I'm the 100th person elite doll!

Single_Acquire_R_001.wav
  It's been a year already... I was told not to forget how grateful I am to you, so I'll keep working hard for you, Commander!

Single_Acquire_SSR_001.wav
  Today is the day I will meet with the Commander and celebrate the anniversary of the first year. I have to celebrate it grandly! Hmm... Ah! How about painting the Hermogon red!?

Single_Anniversary_001.wav
  Commander, you've been doing the same thing for years, so you're amazing. I've never been doing this for three months. Ah, no, no, no. Commander, if I start to slouch, be sure to scold me.

Single_Birthday_R_001.wav
  Ta-da! Happy birthday, Commander! Huh? You forgot? Commander, you're such a bad forget-me-not!

Single_Birthday_SSR_001.wav
  Commander, I'll cast a spell that will make you a year older in a flash! Eh? That wasn't funny? I knew it, I didn't listen to Chouki!

Single_Birthday_SSR_002.wav
  You've gotten one more year older, Commander! I remember you saying that the older a person gets, the more they look different, but... Commander hasn't changed at all, has she? Well, no matter how old you get, you're still a Commander, right?

Single_Children_001.wav
  Don't treat me like a child. I don't like candy anymore. But... If it's in front of you, you can stay as a child for a day. Just for today.

Single_Christmas_001.wav
  How about we do something a little different this year? For example... We can make a tree with a costume! We can surprise everyone who comes to get a present! Isn't that interesting?

Single_Christmas_002.wav
  It's okay to get off the chimney. If you really are there, you're definitely a master of martial arts, aren't you? Huh? That means... Do I have the right to be Santa? Where should I put the Commander's present? The bedroom? The warehouse? Or somewhere else?

Single_Duanwu_001.wav
  I saw Meirin take two flyers and leave... Air Dragon Boat? There's no water, so at least the atmosphere is fine? Ehh! Sounds fun! I'll do it too!

Single_Friendliness_001.wav
  Come on, you're not a kid, so don't pat my head.

Single_Friendliness_002.wav
  I'm not skipping today! I know the structure of the Ermo!

Single_Friendliness_003.wav
  If you're not busy, I'll go home. I'm going to practice with you online.

Single_Friendliness_004.wav
  My sister told me not to let you stay up late, so go to bed early today!

Single_Friendliness_005.wav
  Umm... Commander, is there any way to get the money quickly? The band seems to be in trouble, so I wonder if I can do something.

Single_Friendliness_006.wav
  Look, look, Commander! I learned a new skill from Caloric! I'll surprise you this time!

Single_Friendliness_007.wav
  Today's your day off, right? Why are you staring at the terminal again? I'm looking for you!

Single_Friendliness_008.wav
  Commander, you're always sitting down, right? Come on, let's exercise together and move your body!

Single_Friendliness_009.wav
  I feel like the Commander has been getting more and more like my sister lately. I-I don't think she's being mean or anything. I'm just not used to it.

Single_Friendliness_010.wav
  Ahem! Commander, I'm an elite doll, so you can rely on me anytime if you have any problems.

Single_Friendliness_011.wav
  I'm not a kid, so why do I always do dangerous things? Ah, I was a little like a big sister just now!

Single_Friendliness_012.wav
  Why am I the only one who can write this psychological test in the name of the person I like? I love you and the Commander so much... Ah, come on! I quit, I quit!

Single_Friendliness_013.wav
  Don't worry about me! I'll make your stomach and belly fat all plump! So don't make that face and smile, Commander!

Single_Login_001.wav
  Hello, Commander! How are you? I'm just as good as before!

Single_MidAutumn_001.wav
  Tonight's moon is round, big, and it's like a light bulb! Commander, why don't we go see it together?

Single_MidAutumn_002.wav
  Commander! I heard a legend about the Chushu legend from my sister, so I'll tell you! Well, one day, suddenly, ten moon... Huh? No... Did I remember it wrong?

Single_NewYear_001.wav
  Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Or something like that. I don't have to continue the work that didn't end last year, right?

Single_NewYear_002.wav
  3, 2, 1! Ah! Can you hear it? It's the sound of the bell! Hey, did you know? If you celebrate the new year with someone, you can stay together forever! This way, we'll be together forever this year!

Single_Obon_001.wav
  I wonder if Chouki and Onee-chan are having a bonfire party right now. It's a bit disappointing that we can't spend it together. Commander, why don't we go to the rooftop to light the lanterns? I secretly took one.

Single_Obtain_SSR_001.wav
  Did something troublesome happen? Then leave it to me!

Single_SpringFes_001.wav
  Happy New Year, Commander! Was I the best? Hehe, give me a year's worth of money!

Single_SpringFes_002.wav
  Happy New Year, Commander! I came to say hello to my sister, but I wanted to see her soon, so I left her behind. When my sister arrives, let's all eat together!

Single_ThanksGiving_001.wav
  Today is the day of gratitude, so I brought a lot of pumpkin! Use it in the pumpkin race, and you can make pumpkin pie! How is it? You're interested, right?

Single_Title_001.wav
  Dolls Front Line 2 Exilium!

Single_Valentine_001.wav
  I'm not as good as you are, so I made a chocolate soup with lots of love. This is the opposite of the idea! Sasa, try it!

Single_Valentine_002.wav
  I've been making chocolate seriously this year! I'm putting my heart into Valentine's chocolate! I've prepared a lot of chocolate to show you how big my heart is!

Single_WhiteVale_001.wav
  Do you remember that I like red? Eh? That doesn't mean anything, though? W-Wait! I told you my favorite color, why didn't you prepare a present for me?
