  Sure thing.

Series_Battle_Start__VO_Qiongjiu_Series_Tone_Positive_002.wav
  Roger that.

Series_Chosen_Auto__VO_Qiongjiu_Series_Tone_Positive_007.wav
  Follow me.

Series_Chosen__VO_Qiongjiu_Series_Tone_Positive_006.wav
  Now!

Series_Daily_001.wav
  The mission report is stored in order of numbers. Clothes must be stored in different colors and types. Don't tell me everyone is different?

Series_Daily_002.wav
  When I'm free, I scrape the water and make small accessories. Doing so will ease my tension.

Series_Daily_003.wav
  In this day and age, you can't just be stupidly serious. Sometimes, there's no need to be so perverted. If you're a commander, you know better than I do.

Series_Daily_004.wav
  I've only learned about alcohol because I needed it for work. If only I could have a relationship with my boss's words for work.

Series_Daily_005.wav
  The name of the sword is taken from the poem. Read it, Keikyu. It means to be modest and beautiful. I must be diligent to make this name come true.

Series_Daily_006.wav
  Commander, you don't have to worry about work. We have to keep an eye on the Kiren so that it doesn't fall.

Series_Daily_007.wav
  The Elmo dolls seem to be full of freaks and are about to burn their hands. You're going to learn to feel close to Captain Groza.

Series_Daily_008.wav
  The total amount of the general staff's capital this season is over 35%. I was prepared for this long ago, but... Seriously... Who's the cause? Cheetah? Or Linda?

Series_Daily_009.wav
  If you don't act with discipline, you won't be able to make a good performance. As the captain, you don't have to be strict with the crew. I intend to be more careful with Chita.

Series_Daily_010.wav
  With the power of the General Staff, I can make any request you want. Hm? You're planning to take over my job? If that's what you're thinking...

Series_Die__VO_Qiongjiu_Series_Tone_Negative_001.wav
  Ugh!

Series_Dying__VO_Qiongjiu_Series_HittedLast__VO_Qiongjiu_Series_Tone_Negative_002.wav
  One more time!

Series_Hit__VO_Qiongjiu_Single_Hit_001.wav
  Where are you looking?

Series_HittedLast.wav
  Ugh!

Series_Kill__VO_Qiongjiu_Single_Kill_001.wav
  It's over.

Series_Lose__VO_Qiongjiu_Single_Lose_001.wav
  I'm sorry, I wasn't considerate enough. I'll withdraw for now. I'll be careful next time.

Series_Set_Click__VO_Qiongjiu_Series_Tone_Positive_004.wav
  Yoi!

Series_Skill01__VO_Qiongjiu_Single_Skill_001.wav
  I'll protect you!

Series_Skill02__VO_Qiongjiu_Single_Skill_002.wav
  Now!

Series_Tone_Positive_008.wav
  Keep your guard up!

Series_Tone_Positive_009.wav
  What are you doing?

Series_Tone_Positive_010.wav
  Wait here for a moment.

Series_Ultimate__VO_Qiongjiu_Single_Ultimate_SSR_001.wav
  If you polish the bullets, you will not have a vessel!

Series_Up_001.wav
  Don't worry.

Series_Up_002.wav
  It's going well.

Series_Up_003.wav
  I think you can still do it.

Series_Up_004.wav
  Not a big deal.

Series_Up_005.wav
  If we don't come up with a new plan...

Series_Up_006.wav
  Leave it to me.

Series_Up_007.wav
  This is surprising.

Series_Up_008.wav
  I'm looking forward to it.

Series_Win__VO_Qiongjiu_Single_Win_001.wav
  The battlefield is clear. Everyone, well done.

Single_Acquire_R_001.wav
  We've been busy for the past year. I hope we can calm down a little more from now on.

Single_Acquire_SSR_001.wav
  In Buddhist novels, there is a saying that means, I thought that I wouldn't be able to reunite with you in this vast world, but that thought has changed in this year. The world may be surprisingly small.

Single_Anniversary_001.wav
  In this year, it seems that Kiren has also gone through a lot. Just by looking at the strategy record, there was a lot to gain. From now on, I will learn from Kiren, Commander.

Single_Birthday_R_001.wav
  Happy birthday! There's nothing to be so surprised about. Everyone's birthdays are put in the calendar and the notifications are coming. If it's a miracle, then even more so.

Single_Birthday_SSR_001.wav
  Commander, I'm glad that you've grown another year. I'm thinking of learning how to eat soba from you, but... I'm going to study the recipe, so can you wait for me? I'll be there in a few minutes.

Single_Birthday_SSR_002.wav
  Commander, happy birthday. As you can see, I'm free today. I can go out with you no matter what. Now, please make a proposal without hesitation.

Single_Children_001.wav
  Cheetah's toys, Rindo's candy, and Tororo's photo book... They're all here. Why did Soregashi give them their protective gear? That's right, Commander! I had prepared a loli-pop candy for Kiden. Rindo has a secret, after all.

Single_Christmas_001.wav
  Santa Claus... How suspicious... It really is suspicious! Jumping over the roof, riding on a sleigh, and sending various presents without even seeking a return... Wait... This is like... a fairy tale... saving the weak, crushing the strong... Isn't it a beautiful answer?

Single_Christmas_002.wav
  Commander, we've searched every exit today, but we haven't found anyone like Santa Claus yet. Since everyone's asking for it, we should build a substitute Santa Claus here.

Single_Duanwu_001.wav
  Raise your head, stretch your chest, straighten your body, and raise your back. Yes, that's right. And then if you drink the Yu-O-Shu, you can get rid of your sickness and dizziness, Commander.

Single_Friendliness_001.wav
  Why are you staying here? If there's anything, just say it.

Single_Friendliness_002.wav
  I have an idea for the future of the Hermo. I'll send you a detailed plan by mail, so can you take a look?

Single_Friendliness_003.wav
  The remaining tasks are... I see, there are only 7 left. I'll put them all together one by one, so don't worry.

Single_Friendliness_004.wav
  Commander, wouldn't you mind staying put? Haha, alright! My collar was already torn, I guess. Ack. A sliver sharp huh.

Single_Friendliness_005.wav
  Cheetah is playing pranks on Kiden? Sorry, I'll scold you later. But, that hairstyle... It looks surprisingly good on you.

Single_Friendliness_006.wav
  Commander, do you understand traditional theater? I sing it sometimes, but I can't get the hang of it. In this field, dolls are still in development.

Single_Friendliness_007.wav
  It's more important to achieve your mission than to be evaluated by others. But even if that's the case, I'm curious about what everyone thinks. Commander, why are you looking away?

Single_Friendliness_008.wav
  A horn? Ah, where did you hear that from? It's something that can be said to be the black history of the Soregashi. If you talk, it will be long. So this time, can I talk to you slowly?

Single_Friendliness_009.wav
  I thought that Kiden was always being too strict with me. Maybe Sregashi was closer to Kiden than this.

Single_Friendliness_010.wav
  Commander, how about a drink? No, what... I thought that if you were by my side, the taste of the sake would change.

Single_Friendliness_011.wav
  I thought it was extremely inefficient to have a half-sword up to the front. However, after meeting with the Commander, that thought has been wavering. Ah, is this the one from the pre-war novel, the one called Satori?

Single_Friendliness_012.wav
  Commander, lately, you've been... ...sticking to me like a thorn. In other words, is that really okay?

Single_Friendliness_013.wav
  Commander, I understand how you feel. It's a shame that we can't travel together, but when you encounter danger, I'll protect you. I swear on this gun.

Single_Login_001.wav
  Commander, you don't seem to be in a bad mood. Well then, let's go!

Single_MidAutumn_001.wav
  Raise the cup and welcome the moon of light. Make a three-person shadow. The moon is beautiful tonight. Why don't you relax and enjoy the peace?

Single_MidAutumn_002.wav
  The sky that glows in the bright moon. It's truly the best day. Commander, let's have a look at the moon with the

Single_NewYear_001.wav
  Commander, let's hope for a new year with a new heart. By the way, I've prepared a New Year's card, but I wonder if it would be better to say the words of celebration. ... I wish you and everyone else a safe trip to Ermo! Happy New Year!

Single_NewYear_002.wav
  Happy New Year, Commander. Ah, I've been waiting for you to come out. I wanted to be the first doll you meet in the new year. Hm? It's not a big reason, but... If I may say so... I thought it would be a good year.

Single_Obon_001.wav
  Commander? I didn't know I wouldn't even be heard, ah, were you Ryouha Bτό's maid? Hurrying and going at the same time, went out of my way to вамit.

Single_Obtain_SSR_001.wav
  I'm glad to be able to work with you again. I'll do my best to become a support for you.

Single_Passive_SSR_001.wav
  ひぎ! いっせん!

Single_SpringFes_001.wav
  On a day like this, Elmo-sum City just benighted. With Gizeh here, I can find a sense of kindness. Today, I came to offer leave to all of the General Staff. ...And I brought some good sake.

Single_SpringFes_002.wav
  I managed to make it in time for the new outfit. I'm planning to wear it tonight, but how is it, Commander? Doesn't it look good on you? There's still time until the wedding. I'll have to fix it a little more.

Single_ThanksGiving_001.wav
  It seems that a hydrangea has the effect of changing the flow of luck. I put a hydrangea necklace I made in a hurry in Kiden's room, but I wonder if he'll like it. Umm, or was Turkey better?

Single_Title_001.wav
  Dolls Front Line 2 Exilium

Single_Valentine_001.wav
  Commander, you've already obtained quite a lot of chocolates today, haven't you? Now, which of the chocolates that Soregas sent you, will Kiden understand?

Single_Valentine_002.wav
  I made the cressential shape for the chocolates delivered to Kiden. If this would help to somehow constrain would to I hope.

Single_WhiteVale_001.wav
  I found a box tied up in a rope in front of the break room, but what is this? Huh? Commander, was this a return gift from Kiden? I'm sorry, but in that sense...
