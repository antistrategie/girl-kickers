Series_Battle_Start__VO_ZhaoHui_Series_Tone_Positive_002.wav
  Huh?

Series_Chosen_Auto__VO_ZhaoHui_Series_Up_005.wav
  I'll start right away.

Series_Chosen__VO_ZhaoHui_Series_Up_003.wav
  You can still get stronger.

Series_Daily_001.wav
  I got a new knife. Want to try it?

Series_Daily_002.wav
  Team management is the same as ensemble. We must take advantage of the strengths of each instrument and be aware of the harmony of the tones.

Series_Daily_003.wav
  I'm the leader of Soyoukaze, but I often seek advice from Lian. Kou and Fei are sometimes useful.

Series_Daily_004.wav
  The damage to my right arm hasn't been completely healed, but it doesn't affect the battle.

Series_Daily_005.wav
  No matter how good a weapon is, the important thing is the user's skill.

Series_Daily_006.wav
  No matter the past, it will be a way to the future.

Series_Daily_007.wav
  I don't think I can do the same as Groza, but I have a lot to learn. For example, how to make a problem.

Series_Daily_008.wav
  How to produce high quality work and promote it efficiently... There are so many things I have to think about for Soyoukaze. Hey, Commander. Where's Nemesis' room?

Series_Daily_009.wav
  The person in the background represents the essence of the moment. What to do after seeing it is the most difficult.

Series_Daily_010.wav
  People and things you believed in will easily betray and fall apart. So you have to be careful.

Series_Die__VO_ZhaoHui_Series_Tone_Negative_002.wav
  Ambush

Series_Hit__VO_ZhaoHui_Single_Hit_001.wav
  I don't need a change.

Series_Kill__VO_ZhaoHui_Single_Kill_001.wav
  Sleep.

Series_Lose__VO_ZhaoHui_Single_Lose_001.wav
  I'm making plans for the next episode. I won't repeat the same mistake.

Series_Set_Click__VO_ZhaoHui_Series_Up_008.wav
  Do you want to do it again?

Series_Set_Fall__VO_ZhaoHui_Series_Tone_Positive_009.wav
  I'll take your overtime.

Series_Skill01__VO_ZhaoHui_Single_Skill_001.wav
  If we could all do it...

Series_Skill02__VO_ZhaoHui_Single_Skill_002.wav
  5, 4, 1...

Series_Tone_Positive_003.wav
  Roger that.

Series_Tone_Positive_004.wav
  Eh?

Series_Tone_Positive_006.wav
  I won't let you pass through here.

Series_Tone_Positive_007.wav
  Too weak.

Series_Tone_Positive_008.wav
  How pathetic.

Series_Tone_Positive_010.wav
  Don't get carried away.

Series_Ultimate__VO_ZhaoHui_Single_Ultimate_SSR_001.wav
  It's useless to resist.

Series_Up_001.wav
  Nice.

Series_Up_002.wav
  Not bad.

Series_Up_004.wav
  I look forward to your cooperation.

Series_Up_006.wav
  Thank you.

Series_Up_007.wav
  I feel like my performance has improved.

Series_Win__VO_ZhaoHui_Single_Win_001.wav
  Let's start the party when we get back. Just kidding.

Single_Acquire_SSR_001.wav
  You like making anniversaries, don't you? Hm? No, it doesn't mean anything weird. My days with you are fun, so I don't think I need any anniversaries.

Single_Anniversary_001.wav
  I never thought I'd stay in the same place for so long. Not bad.

Single_Birthday_SSR_001.wav
  Happy birthday, Commander. I see. This is the feeling of celebrating your birthday.

Single_Children_001.wav
  Most children run away or cry when they see me, but why did I have to go on a live performance on Children's Day? Are you going to make me wear a fear mask?

Single_Christmas_001.wav
  Kou-kun told me that I practiced a Christmas song for the Christmas concert. Shall I listen to it?

Single_Duanwu_001.wav
  I think it's better to carry the nightdress than to hang it on the door.

Single_Friendliness_001.wav
  My room is a dead end? No, I don't care if there's a bedside table.

Single_Friendliness_002.wav
  It seems that the Danyens highly appreciate you, but I have my own opinions.

Single_Friendliness_003.wav
  Because the facial expression function is broken.

Single_Friendliness_004.wav
  It's good to complain about it in a rough way, but if you don't have the confidence to make it work, you shouldn't.

Single_Friendliness_005.wav
  I'm getting tired of this. Commander, will you go with me to practice? You can choose whatever you like from my collection.

Single_Friendliness_006.wav
  Scars? I don't intend to heal them. They can be a threat, and I'm good at keeping people who don't know me quiet.

Single_Friendliness_007.wav
  I'm in charge of the water-sailing instruments as a performer. What does it feel like? I just recently learned a new song, so I can let you hear it now.

Single_Friendliness_008.wav
  Those who share the same spirit don't need words. Right, Commander?

Single_Friendliness_009.wav
  Is my smile that weird? Kou-kun made me look creepy. Eh? The reason I laughed? I think it's because I was thinking about you.

Single_Friendliness_010.wav
  Ah, so you were here. I came to check on you. I don't have anything to do.

Single_Friendliness_011.wav
  I couldn't believe that there were so many important people in the past. For me now, bonds are not a wind of taste anymore. It's power.

Single_Friendliness_012.wav
  I don't like long stories, but if you want to hear them, I'll be there.

Single_Friendliness_013.wav
  Thank you for taking the same path as me, Commander.

Single_Login_001.wav
  Ready. I can go anytime.

Single_MidAutumn_001.wav
  Want to go see the moon? What? Is it that strange that you're inviting me? It's true that you can raise your head and look at the moon by yourself, but I want to know how it feels to look at it with someone.

Single_NewYear_001.wav
  I got a VIP ticket for the New Year's joint concert that Soyoukaze invited. I've taken your part, so come see it if you like.

Single_Obon_001.wav
  For a doll, the body that was abandoned is the cause of death. The number of bodies that I've ruined... I don't know. I don't care.

Single_Obtain_SSR_001.wav
  Nice to meet you. I'm Chouki. You're the commander of the Daien? I guess I should call you that too.

Single_Passive_SSR_001.wav
  I can't talk about it.

Single_SpringFes_001.wav
  A wish for the new year? No, I don't have one. I'm already satisfied with just having important people around.

Single_ThanksGiving_001.wav
  I got a flag of gratitude, but it had some funny words written on it. Eh? Was it that funny? More than my own story?

Single_Title_001.wav
  Dolls Front Line 2, Exilium.

Single_Valentine_001.wav
  Yes, I bought this chocolate from the office. The clerk said it was for someone important, so I'll give it to you. Why you? Because I like you. Maybe.

Single_WhiteVale_001.wav
  This is... a skeleton knife that was sold out. As a thank you for the chocolate? Thank you. I'll keep it carefully. It's a waste to use it.

VO_Zhaohui_Single_Birthday_SSR_002.wav
  You said you wanted a kiss the other day, right? I've prepared it, so how about cutting the cake with this today? Happy birthday, Commander.

VO_Zhaohui_Single_Christmas_002.wav
  I never really cared about Santa Claus's story. But if it's a good day to send something to you, it might not be so bad. Commander, what do you want today?

VO_Zhaohui_Single_MidAutumn_002.wav
  Congratulations. The commander who answers my riddle will receive a present later. I look forward to what you will receive.

VO_Zhaohui_Single_NewYear_002.wav
  Do you have any requests for the year-end banquet? If you do, I plan to take you on tonight's stage. I want to answer the captain's expectations first this year.

VO_Zhaohui_Single_SpringFes_002.wav
  I left the ball in the pillow. It's not a child-treatment, but I just want you to sleep and have a good New Year. I'll be by your side, so sleep well.

VO_Zhaohui_Single_Valentine_002.wav
  Ah, so you were listening. No, I was just practicing a special song for my date with the Commander. This will give it a more special feel, right?
