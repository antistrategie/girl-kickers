  Please forgive me...

VO_Mechty_Series_Cancel.wav
  It's a pain in the ass.

VO_Mechty_Series_Chosen.wav
  Don't pull me...

VO_Mechty_Series_Chosen_Auto.wav
  I don't.

VO_Mechty_Series_Daily_001.wav
  If I stay here, I won't be able to find you... I-I won't tell you if you come...

VO_Mechty_Series_Daily_002.wav
  Amazing... Hell Cob, you're more like heaven... 2% 2% 2% 2% 2% 9% 8% 8% 50% 50% !!

VO_Mechty_Series_Daily_003.wav
  Kurukai is really rough. If you use high-power mode so often, I won't be able to hold it.

VO_Mechty_Series_Daily_004.wav
  Ah, I wish I had a kind mechanic like Merlin. Delte wants to play with my body right away.

VO_Mechty_Series_Daily_005.wav
  Wow, so that's how powerful you are. Could that backpack be an external battery?

VO_Mechty_Series_Daily_006.wav
  This mission... I should have come with Andris... Ah... My land of love...

VO_Mechty_Series_Daily_007.wav
  Oh no! If I don't finish my mission quickly, I won't make it to the new release of Biocrisis!

VO_Mechty_Series_Daily_008.wav
  The moment you accept that you are incompetent, you will be freed from everything. Hey, how's that? New profile, isn't it cool?

VO_Mechty_Series_Daily_009.wav
  The beauty department is a little noisy, but when she's there, Kurukai doesn't have time to care about me, so it's easy.

VO_Mechty_Series_Daily_010.wav
  It's like a manga, the next cut is the end of the mission. It's not a good thing.

VO_Mechty_Series_Die.wav
  ~!

VO_Mechty_Series_Hit.wav
  Oraora!

  Euro G sleeves

  Shut up!

VO_Mechty_Series_Lose.wav
  The battery ran out... Let's withdraw this time. Next time, I'll definitely...

  Yes, yes.

VO_Mechty_Series_Set_Fall.wav
  Cute!

VO_Mechty_Series_Skill01.wav
  I'll give it to you!

VO_Mechty_Series_Skill02.wav
  I'll finish this and go home!

VO_Mechty_Series_Tone_Negative_002.wav
  Ouch!

  Really?

  Go, go!

VO_Mechty_Series_Ultimate.wav
  Go to sleep!

VO_Mechty_Series_Up_001.wav
  And damn it...

VO_Mechty_Series_Up_002.wav
  It's over.

VO_Mechty_Series_Up_003.wav
  Is it okay if I do it?

VO_Mechty_Series_Up_004.wav
  Ui... I'm getting a little too strong...

VO_Mechty_Series_Up_005.wav
  I-I'm done, right?

VO_Mechty_Series_Up_006.wav
  You're still going to do it?

VO_Mechty_Series_Up_008.wav
  I'm the strongest right now!

VO_Mechty_Series_Win.wav
  I'm finally done... Can I sleep for a day after I get home? Oh no... I'm so sleepy...

VO_Mechty_Single_Acquire_R_001.wav
  I couldn't achieve my sleep schedule this year. Commander, do you have a paid vacation in Hermo? If not, I'll just sleep for three days and nights.

VO_Mechty_Single_Acquire_SSR_001.wav
  It's only been a year since I've been back. It's like I've been working for three years. So... Would you give me a vacation if I worked hard for a year?

VO_Mechty_Single_Anniversary_001.wav
  Ehh, you've been working non-stop for a year? As expected of a commander, I don't have a week. Besides, it's not a good thing that I work anyway.

VO_Mechty_Single_Birthday_R_001.wav
  Today is the captain's birthday, right? I've prepared the game and the potatoes, so why don't we have a home party from now on?

VO_Mechty_Single_Birthday_SSR_001.wav
  Happy birthday, Commander! Here we go... I made my favorite... I made my favorite... It was hard to collect all the ships... When you finish reading, let me know your impressions!

VO_Mechty_Single_Birthday_SSR_002.wav
  Happy birthday, Commander. This is a game for two people that I chose to choose. I think you'll definitely like it. If you call me, I'll play with you during the break.

VO_Mechty_Single_Children_001.wav
  I'm handing out balloons over there, so can you get them for me? Because I look like a child? Hmm... I guess I have no choice.

VO_Mechty_Single_Christmas_001.wav
  If Santa comes, please wake me up. I want to know how I can live once a year.

VO_Mechty_Single_Christmas_002.wav
  Speaking of Christmas presents, surprise! Find out where my present is. It's okay. The commander is always at the place where I go.

VO_Mechty_Single_Duanwu_001.wav
  I heard that Meirin is making delicious food, so I came to see how it is. Wow, what is this leaf? Eh? Do I have to wrap it in this? I guess it's okay.

VO_Mechty_Single_Friendliness_001.wav
  You shouldn't expect anything strange from me.

VO_Mechty_Single_Friendliness_002.wav
  Where is my room? I want to try the effect of the new sleeping bag I bought.

VO_Mechty_Single_Friendliness_003.wav
  Hmm... You still have time to leave, right? Let me sleep for 5 minutes...

VO_Mechty_Single_Friendliness_004.wav
  The Hermo's facilities are full, but there's something missing... Ah, how about this sofa that can make people feel bad? I'll send you a link, so buy it later!

VO_Mechty_Single_Friendliness_005.wav
  I heard that you would give my Switch to the Commander, but... If possible, I won't use it again... Eh, Tamma, Tamma! Don't try to use it from the side I'm talking about!

VO_Mechty_Single_Friendliness_006.wav
  I don't know if you say it all at once, so talk more slowly. Eh? Do you have a mission? Can I skip it?

VO_Mechty_Single_Friendliness_007.wav
  Why are you all working so hard? It's best to lie down and rest. Look, like this.

VO_Mechty_Single_Friendliness_008.wav
  I heard that the company that is about to collapse is extremely strict in bloodshed... I'm wondering if the Commander has been watching me lately...

VO_Mechty_Single_Friendliness_009.wav
  If you're so worried, you'll lose your head, right? Hm? Will I get stronger if I lose my head?

VO_Mechty_Single_Friendliness_010.wav
  You want to play games? I'll lend you my account. The ID is Pink Nyanyan Punch. Ehe, what a nice name.

VO_Mechty_Single_Friendliness_011.wav
  Ah, Commander... I just came to visit the command room, so don't worry about it. Oh, it looks good to take a nap in this chair. Can I leave some snacks here?

VO_Mechty_Single_Friendliness_012.wav
  Wow, the command room is really messy. Ah, I think I can lie down here.

VO_Mechty_Single_Friendliness_013.wav
  Commander, are you pushing my switch? Because when I hear your voice, I'm all sleepy.

VO_Mechty_Single_Login_001.wav
  Ah, you're here, Commander. It's just in time, so let's take a nap.

VO_Mechty_Single_MidAutumn_001.wav
  Hmm... The moon is beautiful. I'll sleep on a day like this. Ah! Did the rabbit just fly? No, I'm sure it was a mistake.

VO_Mechty_Single_MidAutumn_002.wav
  Coke is good, Potato chips are good, Game is good, And then, the moon is good. Now, after that, I'll call everyone and watch the moon in the game. If this is the case, you can watch the moon from morning to night, right?

VO_Mechty_Single_NewYear_001.wav
  Happy New Year, Commander. This year's plan? Yeah... Last year, I was told to come and I wrote a lot, but I couldn't achieve any of them... Ah, don't tell me to come. I'll definitely get killed.

VO_Mechty_Single_NewYear_002.wav
  Akeome... When I'm with you, time just flies by so fast... I guess I'll go do some New Year's now.

VO_Mechty_Single_Obon_001.wav
  Nn... nn... nn... Ah! It's already night!? Commander, wake up! Wake up! I've been waiting for today to come! There's no ghost, so let's go see it!

VO_Mechty_Single_Obtain_SSR_001.wav
  Yes, yes. I'm Mifty, who is selfless and easy to use. Has my luggage already arrived at Hermo?

VO_Mechty_Single_Passive_SSR_001.wav
  That was close, that was close.

VO_Mechty_Single_SpringFes_001.wav
  Helmet will come, backpack will come. Hmm, I'll give this special sale safety kit to the commander. Ah, commander! Since when did you come here?

VO_Mechty_Single_SpringFes_002.wav
  Happy New Year, Commander. How about you take a break from the New Year's Day? It's a New Year's Day when you're with someone important, right?

VO_Mechty_Single_ThanksGiving_001.wav
  Though I came here to pass on these seven-sided nervousness, And walk away the feeling of gratitude I get near you. They didn't miss a woman Iünüji once saw from the geen of a truck... 222 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 222 2 222 222 222 222 222 222 223 222 222 222 222 222 223 223 223 223 224 224 224 225 226 227 227 229 228 228 228 229 228 229 2280 229 2210 22 GG

VO_Mechty_Single_Title_001.wav
  Dolls Front Line 2... Exil...

VO_Mechty_Single_Valentine_001.wav
  Wow, there's a lot of evidence. Commander, you're a sinner. There was a character who was beaten by 9 people in the game and had a terrible eye, but do you know what he was called? On the roof... I know this place! I won't say it anymore!

VO_Mechty_Single_Valentine_002.wav
  Choco, are you getting a lot? No, I saw how many you guys are making. Here, this is my chocolate. If it's only twice, I'm confident that I won't lose to anyone.

VO_Mechty_Single_WhiteVale_001.wav
  What did Tsutsumi, our victim, have on our meditation robes? Huh? For myself? No way… They were about to end upudoing me for a change of 나�ctions, And even a distinction… I've understood now… but… Perhaps I deserve to die, so can you… make the deal. Can't you see?
