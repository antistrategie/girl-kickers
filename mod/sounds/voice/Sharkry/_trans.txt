  364...365! Another year has passed! Phew... I feel like time really flies after meeting the Commander! I'll continue to support Sharkly! It's a promise!

VO_Sharkry_Single_Acquire_SR_001.wav
  In the past, I thought that the flow of time was just increasing the number of days of operation, and there was no special meaning. But this year I met the Commander, every day was warm. Let's continue to make memories together, Commander!

VO_Sharkry_Single_Anniversary_001.wav

  Ta-da! Happy birthday, Commander! For a super idol, remembering the birthday of a loyal fan is a basic of a basic! Hehe, what do you want as a present? A sign? A shake? Or a hug?

VO_Sharkry_Single_Birthday_SSR_002.wav

VO_Sharkry_Single_Duanwu_001.wav
  This green food is kind of weird. It's triangular and sharp. The Springfield manager said that I should temporarily put this in the menu. But even so, why do I have to do a boat show on stage?

VO_Sharkry_Single_Friendliness_001.wav
  Super Idol Sharkly! I'll keep working hard to protect everyone's smiles!

VO_Sharkry_Single_Friendliness_002.wav
  Commander, you know Zucchero, right? Sharkly is doing a show there, but if you don't mind, I'd like you to come see it next time.

VO_Sharkry_Single_Friendliness_003.wav
  Commander, you don't look well. If you have any hope, Sharkly will show you the best show anytime!

VO_Sharkry_Single_Friendliness_004.wav
  Commander, when you move your body, you will be given a lot of dopamine that makes you feel happy! So, why don't you dance with me now?

VO_Sharkry_Single_Friendliness_005.wav
  I've been to quite a few places, but there's no one who's more eye-catching than the cafe's customers. Hehe, I wonder how the commander's eyes are.

VO_Sharkry_Single_Friendliness_006.wav
  Commander, you can't wrinkle your forehead! You look tired. If you're going to sleep, should I sing a lullaby for you?

VO_Sharkry_Single_Friendliness_007.wav
  Ho, ho! Commander, looks are very important! So I'll make it for you! Ufiii, I won't play pranks! Don't worry!

VO_Sharkry_Single_Friendliness_008.wav
  How was it, the show earlier? It was really good, right? B-Bepri compared to... How was it?

VO_Sharkry_Single_Friendliness_009.wav
  Recently, I've been looking for the commander in the audience seat. Please sit in the front row when you sit down. Then you can find it in one eye.

VO_Sharkry_Single_Friendliness_010.wav
  Commander, do you have time after the show is over tonight? An hour? No, 30 minutes is fine. I have something I want to take you to. Let's go secretly, just the two of us. Right?

VO_Sharkry_Single_Friendliness_011.wav
  Commander, why are you staring at me like that? What's on my face? Oh, well, I can't help it. It's okay, look. After all, I'm a perfect idol no matter where I look from 360 degrees.

VO_Sharkry_Single_Friendliness_012.wav
  This necklace is pretty, right? It's the latest model of the year! Will you put it on for me, Commander? Ah, wait, wait, wait! Don't wrap your hair around me!

VO_Sharkry_Single_Friendliness_013.wav
  Hmm... Recently, there's been no excitement among the audience. Throwing kisses and winking are now in the late days. I have to think of some new action. Hehehe. Commander, will you be my training partner?

VO_Sharkry_Single_Login_001.wav
  Commander, that was perfect! Hey, which outfit should I wear for today's show?

VO_Sharkry_Single_MidAutumn_001.wav
  Idols are like the moon, shining in the darkness, accepting everyone's wishes and thoughts. Someone said that, but I don't think so. I will become the moon's idol and have everyone come to the moon!

VO_Sharkry_Single_MidAutumn_002.wav
  Hmm... Commander... I got a goldfish sake from Meirin, but... My head is spinning... Is this what Meirin said about being spoiled by the moon? Hey, Commander... Which one of us smells better, me or this sake?

VO_Sharkry_Single_NewYear_001.wav
  Commander, Happy New Year! Commander, do you have anything you want to ask me? About Sharkly... I want to be with you every year from now on! Uhehe! Are you getting dizzy? What? If I say it, it's meaningless? Ah! Wait, wait! What was that just now!?

VO_Sharkry_Single_NewYear_002.wav
  Stop it, Commander! Look at this camera! Here! Cheese! I'll sign your first two-shot for the new year! Please keep pushing Sharkly this year!

VO_Sharkry_Single_Obon_001.wav
  Do you know Ghost Diva? It's about an idol who sings a song that is unbearably good like Beppuie. Uhehe, just kidding! The concept of the cafe tonight is ghostly. I'm waiting for you to visit the command center!

VO_Sharkry_Single_Obtain_SR_001.wav
  Ehehe, I'm ready! Who will be the lucky one to be pulled out by Sharklin?

VO_Sharkry_Single_SpringFes_001.wav
  Phew, we made it! It's getting exciting! This is the first time I've ever celebrated a day like this! I should have refused to invite you to the live show! Ah, the fireworks are starting to fly! Happy Spring Festival, Commander! Does this look right? Ehehe

VO_Sharkry_Single_SpringFes_002.wav
  Eh? The party in the spring, the commander and Sharkly will be there? What would be good? A duet? Dance? Or... Music? Whatever it is, Sharkly will do her best!

VO_Sharkry_Single_ThanksGiving_001.wav
  Today, I'm going to have a special break at the cafe, so I've prepared a pumpkin pie as a thank you for the Commander for the past year! Uhehe! Please look forward to the dinner!
