  Alright! I did my best for a year! I can rest today!

VO_Lenna_Series_Battle_Start.wav
  I'll finish it today too!

VO_Lenna_Series_Chosen.wav
  Good feeling?

VO_Lenna_Series_Daily_001.wav
  Foo Foo Foo Good morning, Commander! Me? I'm going to contact Revanee from now on! Ehehe

VO_Lenna_Series_Daily_002.wav
  Eh? There's still work to do? No way... Alright, let's finish this quickly!

VO_Lenna_Series_Daily_003.wav
  Oh, it's a sunny day today. I guess I should get going.

VO_Lenna_Series_Daily_004.wav
  That was... Ribanee? Eh? To the Commander? Ehh, what does Ribanee mean? That's fine, tell me! Because I haven't gotten a call from Ribanee for a long time! Even two days is long enough!

VO_Lenna_Series_Daily_005.wav
  Ehehe, how about this outfit? It's cool, right? I designed it for Karin-nee's mission. But I prefer the previous outfit. Because it's the same as Riva-nee's.

VO_Lenna_Series_Daily_006.wav
  Ah, I want to hear Tiba-nee's voice! Hm? Ah, it's 4-5-nee's new codename! I gave it to her!

VO_Lenna_Series_Daily_007.wav
  Ah, I'm tired. It's not all good to be able to work. Hmm?

VO_Lenna_Series_Daily_008.wav
  Yoho, Commander! Long time no see! You've been showing up sometimes, haven't you? Karin-nee is worried about you... Ah, no! She left! Anyway, welcome back, Commander!

VO_Lenna_Series_Daily_009.wav
  Haa, the size is different, but the hairstyle changes too ... Hmm, the commonality with Riva is disappearing ...

VO_Lenna_Series_Daily_010.wav
  Yeah! Mental improvement, firepower improvement, ability improvement! I'm glad I participated in the experiment!

VO_Lenna_Series_Die.wav
  I-I lost!?

  chant

VO_Lenna_Series_Hitted_2.wav
  Oh!

VO_Lenna_Series_Hitted_5.wav
  Ahaha!

VO_Lenna_Series_Kill.wav
  I'm sorry!

VO_Lenna_Series_Lose.wav
  Uu... I'm sorry, Commander... But, as long as I'm with you, we'll be fine! Don't worry!

VO_Lenna_Series_Set_Fall.wav
  No, the effect is excellent!

VO_Lenna_Series_Set_Fall_2.wav
  I'll protect everyone!

VO_Lenna_Series_Skill01.wav
  It's the white owl's voice!

  It was a pity.

VO_Lenna_Series_Ultimate.wav
  White

VO_Lenna_Series_Up_001.wav
  I wonder if I've gotten stronger!

VO_Lenna_Series_Up_005.wav
  Did something change?

VO_Lenna_Series_Up_007.wav
  Will you praise me, Riva?

VO_Lenna_Series_Up_008.wav
  I've become useful to you, Libanee!

VO_Lenna_Series_Win.wav
  Perfect! I can't help but praise you, Riva-nee! Eheheh! Of course I want you to praise me too, Commander!

VO_Lenna_Single_Acquire_R_001.wav
  Huh? Another year has passed? Hmm... I didn't notice at all. Maybe it's because the commander was by my side and I was too relaxed. Ehehe

VO_Lenna_Single_Acquire_SR_001.wav
  I mean, it's already been a year. The Commander is always so naive. The time we spent as a family is not a year.

VO_Lenna_Single_Acquire_SSR_001.wav
  The day we started living together? O-Of course I remember! Hehe, that's right! What should I send to the commander? I'll make him a badge!

VO_Lenna_Single_Anniversary_001.wav
  Alright! I did my best for a year! I can rest for today! Ehehe! Commander, let's leave the trouble to others and enjoy the party together!

VO_Lenna_Single_Birthday_R_001.wav
  Happy birthday! Wait, what's wrong with that face? It's my family's birthday, so of course I should celebrate!

VO_Lenna_Single_Birthday_SR_001.wav
  Commander? Yes! A present! Isn't it wonderful? I chose it with you! Happy birthday!

VO_Lenna_Single_Birthday_SSR_001_TypeA.wav
  Happy birthday, Commander! Ehehe, I didn't think I'd be here! It's a surprise after all! Mission? Don't worry, I've finished it properly!

VO_Lenna_Single_Birthday_SSR_001_TypeB.wav
  Happy birthday! Eheheh! Eh? I won't forget it! Because you're my... Ufufu As I thought, it's a secret! Hurry up and open the present!

VO_Lenna_Single_Birthday_SSR_002.wav
  Today, there's a super, super, super fancy party at the Hermes, but who do you think will be the main character? That's right! We all prepared for you, Commander! I've also prepared a surprise for you, so look forward to it, Commander!

VO_Lenna_Single_Children_001.wav
  Ah, Commander! I'll give you this candy! It's really delicious! It looks cute after all! Ehehe! Hmm? Do you want me to eat it? Sure! Come on, open your mouth! Aaaaah!

VO_Lenna_Single_Christmas_001.wav
  Alright, next I'll put this in here. Ah, Commander! This is the cracker I made. Pepli taught me. Do you want to make it together? If you make it together, it'll look more like a memorial day.

VO_Lenna_Single_Christmas_002.wav
  Merry Christmas! I've got presents for you! If you find something that suits your present, you'll end up buying it without being able to wait!

VO_Lenna_Single_Duanwu_001.wav
  Do you know that the Commander is a Dragon Boat? It seems that he is following the Dragon, but there are also dragons like that. I thought that dragons all had big wings.

VO_Lenna_Single_Friendliness_001.wav
  Ehehe, as expected of the commander! Your footsteps haven't changed at all!

VO_Lenna_Single_Friendliness_002.wav
  Oh my, not the one before? Well, well I'm growing on that one! Lots and lots!

VO_Lenna_Single_Friendliness_003.wav
  Commander, you have to call me Rena here. Oh, yeah, I was told by Viva-nee and I named it after her. I like it.

VO_Lenna_Single_Friendliness_004.wav
  Ah, I was thinking about the Commander earlier. Fufu, it's natural to care about your family, right?

VO_Lenna_Single_Friendliness_005.wav
  Hehe, Commander, the Geranium I raised has finally bloomed! This time I won't let you get away with it!

VO_Lenna_Single_Friendliness_006.wav
  Hey, Commander! What are you doing? We're not that close yet, are we? Well, we're family, but... I-I can't let this go!

VO_Lenna_Single_Friendliness_007.wav
  Oh, Commander? It seems that you need a nose care. Ahahahaha! How? Were you surprised? Ehehe, it's similar.

VO_Lenna_Single_Friendliness_008.wav
  Don't look at me like that. I changed my body, so there's no more wound. I think it's better to carve it again. What do you think, Commander?

VO_Lenna_Single_Friendliness_009.wav
  Thank you for everything, Commander! This is a thank-you kiss! Ahaha, you're serious? Commander's eyes are the same as before!

VO_Lenna_Single_Friendliness_010.wav
  Ah! Look over there, Commander! Over there! Tch! Hehe, that wasn't a joke. How was it? It wasn't as bad as I thought, right?

VO_Lenna_Single_Friendliness_011.wav
  Ehehe, if you suddenly appear, the commander will be surprised. I'm looking forward to seeing your surprised face. But, when will the commander come out? Why are you suddenly coming out?

VO_Lenna_Single_Friendliness_012.wav
  Um, Commander, change is not a bad thing, right? Yeah, everyone's really gotten better. You too, Commander. I have to do my best too!

VO_Lenna_Single_Friendliness_013.wav
  No, I think the Panku style will suit you better. Why don't you try it? I know a good store. Let's go together!

VO_Lenna_Single_MidAutumn_001.wav
  Hehe, the moon that I see with my family looks even more beautiful. It's soft and bright, and I want to be like the moon.

VO_Lenna_Single_MidAutumn_002.wav
  Speaking of the Chushu Festival, it's the day when everyone in the family gathers. Today is the day of the Li-ba, the Karin, and the 404. I'm going to watch the moon, so you should definitely come.

VO_Lenna_Single_NewYear_001.wav
  A wish... I'm happy enough now, but... Ah, it's spread! I hope I can be with everyone and the commander more!

VO_Lenna_Single_NewYear_002.wav
  Commander, have you decided how to spend New Year's? A visit? A long journey? Or shopping? It's up to you what you do, but... You're definitely going to be with your family!

VO_Lenna_Single_Obon_001.wav
  Commander, Commander! I'm going to dress up as a ghost tonight! Huh? Isn't that the day? I thought it was a day that wasn't very different from Halloween, but it wasn't.

VO_Lenna_Single_Obtain_R_001.wav
  Oh, so this is the rumored Elmo Hawker! That's great! I'll make it even more exciting!

VO_Lenna_Single_Obtain_SR_001.wav
  Ah, it's the commander! I'm so glad! I'll protect you properly this time!

VO_Lenna_Single_Obtain_SSR_001.wav
  Ehehe, sorry for the wait! Leave the rest to me!

  Good girl, good girl!

VO_Lenna_Single_SpringFes_001.wav
  Commander! Baa! Ehehe, are you surprised? I tried on a lion costume. Isn't it cute? Today I will dance with Pepli, so please look forward to it!

VO_Lenna_Single_SpringFes_002.wav
  I've prepared a new costume for the commander. After I'm dressed, let's make a movie. The title is... The Spring of the Elm House. Everyone's gathered at the Elm House. I have to enjoy it with all my might.

VO_Lenna_Single_ThanksGiving_001.wav
  Um, you know, Commander, when I was looking for the seven-sided butterfly image earlier, I thought that it would look better after it was cooked. But I have to thank them.

VO_Lenna_Single_Title_001.wav
  Dolls Front Line 2 Exilium

VO_Lenna_Single_Ultimate_SR_001.wav
  Here we go!

VO_Lenna_Single_Valentine_001.wav
  Commander, today is the day to tell your feelings, right? Hehe, so I'm looking forward to it. You're not allowed to be stupid anymore!

VO_Lenna_Single_Valentine_002.wav
  It's about the commander, so today I got a lot of chocolates from everyone, right? Hehe, so I devised a way to make a different chocolate from everyone's! What kind of devise is it? Look forward to opening it!

VO_Lenna_Single_WhiteVale_001.wav
  Eh? Another Valentine's Day? Isn't it too many to have two every year? Ah, but if I can be with you, there might not be many.
