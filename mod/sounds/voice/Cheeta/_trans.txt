  Ta-da! Coming up next is the greatest genius of the century, the all-purpose doll, Cheetah!

Series_Cancel.wav
  Oh, dear.

Series_Chosen__VO_Cheeta_Series_Chosen_Auto__VO_Cheeta_Series_Chosen_Finished.wav
  Ah! What are you looking at?

Series_Daily_001.wav
  Oh, it's a zookeeper! Today, too, you have a face that says, I want to sleep early because I'm tired of work.

Series_Daily_002.wav
  Don't look at me like that. I'm not that small because I like you. It's all because of the Shikuin of the Shikuin!

Series_Daily_003.wav
  Have you seen Honey Badger? I-I'm not that interested in it, but... I don't want her to lose to someone first!

Series_Daily_004.wav
  Seaqueen, buy a new game! Eh? Why? Seaqueen is there to feed the genius cheetah-chan, right?

Series_Daily_005.wav
  Wow... I'm really tired of having a video meeting with the captain... I might as well have my dummy sit next time! And I can also add a function that allows me to answer whatever you ask!

Series_Daily_006.wav
  The fact that I dropped the drone the other day... Keep it to the zookeeper's zookeeper! Or else it'll be really noisy!

Series_Daily_007.wav
  Seekin, Seekin! The Tororo guy won't let me in the room! Isn't that terrible? Geniuses are always lonely in the world.

Series_Daily_008.wav
  Tch... If the speed of rotation is over a certain value, then I just put the alarm system on the engine. Why is Meirin so noisy? Yes, yes, I understand. I'll be careful next time. This is fine, right?

Series_Daily_009.wav
  Hello, Sea Queen! Hm? That reaction... Did you forget my new name? Cheetah! It's Cheetah! Cheetah who eats Lattel! Waaah! No, it wasn't... I think... Chin chin!

Series_Daily_010.wav
  Alright! The next experiment is ready! This is an important step towards defeating Honey Badger! I'll help you, too, Sequin!

Series_Die.wav
  I-I lost!?

Series_Hit__VO_Cheeta_Single_Hit_001.wav
  YAHOO!

Series_HittedLast__VO_Cheeta_Series_Tone_Positive_002.wav
  Boring.

Series_Kill__VO_Cheeta_Single_Kill_001.wav
  Bye bye!

Series_Lose.wav
  It's definitely because the information was wrong!

Series_Move_Start__VO_Cheeta_Series_Set_Fall__VO_Cheeta_Series_Tone_Positive_010.wav
  Look! Look!

Series_Move_Start__VO_Cheeta_Series_Tone_Positive_003.wav
  I'm an idiot!

Series_Move_Start__VO_Cheeta_Series_Tone_Positive_008.wav
  Yes, yes.

Series_Set_Click__VO_Cheeta_Series_Tone_Positive_004.wav
  Yay! Yay!

Series_Set_Fall.wav
  Hello, Seaqueen!

Series_Skill01__VO_Cheeta_Single_Skill_001.wav
  Over here!

Series_Skill02__VO_Cheeta_Single_Skill_002.wav
  That's enough!

Series_Tone_Positive_006.wav
  And become r 귀여 building!

Series_Tone_Positive_007.wav
  Tch, you're in my way.

Series_Tone_Positive_009.wav
  What a pain.

Series_Ultimate__VO_Cheeta_Single_Ultimate_SR_001.wav
  Let's give it a try!

Series_Up_001.wav
  Umm, I guess it's not too bad.

Series_Up_002.wav
  You're still going to do it?

Series_Up_003.wav
  It's fine now, right?

Series_Up_004.wav
  I-I still have more! Give me all of them!

Series_Up_005.wav
  Wow, nice! ... I was told to use the persistently親切的詞料理 , then I wrote it. ... Brother's script is nice my way, is not it? Yeah. It's quite Brasilian, but quite nelus online.

Series_Up_006.wav
  I'm not enough!

Series_Up_007.wav
  Heh, I don't think you can do it, honey-vajar!

Series_Up_008.wav
  This genius has become the final form!

Series_Win__VO_Cheeta_Single_Win_001.wav
  Fufu, as long as I'm here, there's nothing to worry about!

Single_Acquire_R_001.wav
  To be able to stay by this genius for a year... Well, the zookeeper is lucky too!

Single_Acquire_SR_001.wav
  Seekin, Seekin! Today is the anniversary of the 1st anniversary chosen by genius Cheetah! Let's celebrate it together in a match game! Hehe, don't worry, I'll secretly make up for it!

Single_Anniversary_001.wav
  A anniversary? Is it that special? Hmm... I don't know, but if you want to be a zookeeper, why not make it a day of celebration?

Single_Birthday_R_001.wav
  Ah, today is the day the Seekuin was shipped, right? Well, well, the meaning is roughly the same. Congratulations on the ship's anniversary, Seekuin!

Single_Birthday_SR_001.wav
  Seekin, I'll give you this cake. Hurry up and open it! Hurry up! No, what's wrong with looking at such a doubtful look? There's no way there's a balloon in it! Absolutely not!

Single_Birthday_SSR_002.wav
  Today is the day of the Seekers' commemoration! No, it's their birthday! Fufu! Actually, I've made a new invention for this day! It's called the Multidimensional Reconstruction Replicator! You'll be surprised to see it!

Single_Children_001.wav
  I heard the staff today, that... Umm... It's a day when you can't punish children! In other words, I can do whatever I want, right? Yahoo!

Single_Christmas_001.wav
  Ms. Santa, please make me the savior of the Griffins. Please let the honey badger kneel at my feet. If you can't, then... Just make the body the size of the original...

Single_Christmas_002.wav
  I hope Santa will come this year. I'm always a good girl, but why can't I earn all the time? Seriously, everyone has no eyes to see. I'd rather have everyone correct their sense of my invention so that they can understand my ingenuity.

Single_Duanwu_001.wav
  Uee... Ah, Sequin? Si, don't talk! I'm seriously praying for my medicine today. I heard today is the best day to pay off bad luck. No, even a genius can't be lucky.

Single_Friendliness_001.wav
  You know those dear now are like these? The ones that say they are small, them! You knew that, didn't you?!해�'re hiding there!! Really?

Single_Friendliness_002.wav
  Hmm... I don't care what the strategy is. Anyway, a genius doesn't lose. Ah, yes, yes. I'll look at the strategy materials. It's true.

Single_Friendliness_003.wav
  Oh! What are you looking at, Seaqueen? 100,000 great ideas for inventions? I'll look at them too!

Single_Friendliness_004.wav
  Sequin, let's play a game together! Come on, wake up! Geez, you can't rest if you don't sleep every day. Human bodies are too troublesome. Should I make something for you?

Single_Friendliness_005.wav
  Seekuin? What are you doing? Haha, so you were secretly practicing a race game while hiding from me? It's a hundred years too early to say that I, the genius, should win!

Single_Friendliness_006.wav
  You know, Sequin and I are pretty close, aren't we? We're friends, aren't we? Yeah. Then, you know... You're not mad about the explosion in the warehouse, are you?

Single_Friendliness_007.wav
  Uuuh, I don't want to work... I should just skip work. Ah, but I have a mission today. W-Will you go instead of me? Hey, can't I?

Single_Friendliness_008.wav
  The new invention is about to appear! Are you excited? You're excited, right? Alright! Then, get ready to worship me!

Single_Friendliness_009.wav
  Which do you prefer, the previous one or the current one? I-I don't care! I just asked for a reason. I'm going to change it to the original one anyway.

Single_Friendliness_010.wav
  Seaqueen! My new invention! I made a perfect eye-catching machine! If you put this on when you're sleepy, you can pretend to be awake! What do you think? Isn't it amazing?

Single_Friendliness_011.wav
  Seekuin, how much time do you have left before work? Let's play with the special elite together! I can help you!

Single_Friendliness_012.wav
  Ta-da! I'm going to be appearing in this century's greatest genius, the all-powerful doll, Cheetah! If there's anything you want to achieve, I'll be your strength. Um... As far as I can!

Single_Friendliness_013.wav
  Have you seen the latest strategy report? I'm too amazing to blow up the enemy in the strategy area at once! Eh? The mobile base was also involved in a little while ago? No, I don't care about such small things!

Single_Login_001.wav
  Let's go! Our goal is to defeat Honey Badger!

Single_Lose_001.wav
  I-I lost!? It's definitely because I got the wrong information!

Single_MidAutumn_001.wav
  Tch, I wonder how beautiful the moon is. Anyway, look at my linear float shoes. If you wear these, you might be able to go to the moon.

Single_MidAutumn_002.wav
  Seekin, are you looking at the moon again? Well, today's moon is big and beautiful, but... Hm? Is it big because it's a medium-sized moon? Then I'll show you when you want to see it! Make a big and round-shaped artificial moon all year round! Then you can enjoy it every day!

Single_NewYear_001.wav
  No matter how many years pass, my only goal is to leave Honey Badger to you 100 times!

Single_NewYear_002.wav
  Oh, it's the new year again! I'm so happy to spend a year with such a genius inventor! Actually, I have a new invention prepared to make you happy this year, so let's go see it together!

Single_Obon_001.wav
  Don! Do-don! Don! Ahaha! This is so fun! Seaqueen, hurry up and watch my new invention! Hybrid Z-type automatic drum! Today is the day to play drums, right? With this, the rhythm will never be disturbed!

Single_Obtain_SR_001.wav
  Another job? Wait, you're a farmer, right? I can't help it! The greatest genius of the century will help you!

Single_SpringFes_001.wav
  Are you ready, Seaqueen? We're leaving! Huh? You didn't know? Meirin said that there would be a lot of people going to the store during the spring festival... Umm... What was it again? The day of the festival or something like that... Come on, don't just sit there and listen to me! Go change!

Single_SpringFes_002.wav
  Sequin! Hurry up! This year, I've prepared Meirin and the Ultra Hyper Ultimate Mode fireworks! If you see them, no one will be disappointed! Hm? What kind of mode is it? Hehe, that's something to look forward to!

Single_ThanksGiving_001.wav
  Sequin Sequin! I will offer my thanks to the greatest genius of the century, Cheetah-chan, for a year! Ahahahahahah!

Single_Title_001.wav
  Dolls Front Line 2! Exilium!

Single_Valentine_001.wav
  Eh? The day when we communicate our feelings to each other? It's the day when the company buys the product, right? I get it, I get it. Then I'll give you this special full-color fireworks launcher. It's completely automatic, and it mixes colors nicely. Instead, it might explode... Ah, no, it's nothing!

Single_Valentine_002.wav
  Nwaah, I'm so tired. Seriously, what's Valentine's Day? Making chocolate is so easy! Huh? Are you underestimating my cooking skills, Sea Queen? I was going to give you chocolate, but I'm not going to! I won't go home until you eat it in front of me and praise me!

Single_WhiteVale_001.wav
  Hmm, what do I want... I want a large body over 1.7 meters in height! Could it be that Sea Queen will give me a present? Then buy it!
