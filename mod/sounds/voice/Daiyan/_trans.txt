  Please calm down.

Series_Chosen_Auto__VO_Daiyan_Series_Set_Fall__VO_Daiyan_Series_Tone_Positive_001.wav
  Listen carefully.

  Here it is.

Series_Daily_001.wav
  Listening to my performance, my heart is at ease? Yes, if I have helped you, I am happy.

Series_Daily_002__VO_Daiyan_Series_Selected.wav
  I do feel a bit of luck, but she's working hard to fix that. Please give her some time.

Series_Daily_003__VO_Daiyan_Series_Selected.wav
  I've been very helpful to you in both creation and battle. You have a cool appearance and a passionate heart. Is that all?

Series_Daily_004__VO_Daiyan_Series_Selected.wav
  I was invited by Vepri-san to join the live. At first I thought it wouldn't be a good idea, but it turned out to be surprisingly good.

Series_Daily_005.wav
  ...otaiva? Hmm... No...

Series_Daily_006.wav
  I want to travel the world, and write down the scenery, people, and events I've seen.

Series_Daily_007__VO_Daiyan_Series_Selected.wav
  Have you heard of the song called Sentai Fu? The purchase list that Meirin-san gave me had a score of that song, but... It was... ...very expensive...

Series_Daily_008.wav
  I don't like fighting, but if it's to protect everyone, I'm willing to let go of my own self and get the weapon.

Series_Daily_009.wav
  Commander, I'd like to hold a music meeting that was suggested by Corfen-san. Please come with me, Meilin-san.

Series_Daily_010.wav
  The emotions that are conveyed through music are more pure and vivid. So, why don't you teach Nemesis-san to play the instrument?

Series_Die__VO_Daiyan_Series_HittedLast__VO_Daiyan_Series_Tone_Negative_002.wav
  The rhythm is... disturbed...

Series_Die__VO_Daiyan_Series_Shield_Broken__VO_Daiyan_Series_Tone_Positive_008.wav
  That added to your bad performance.

Series_Hit__VO_Daiyan_Single_Hit_001.wav
  There is no break.

Series_Hitted.wav
  Ah!

Series_HittedLast__VO_Daiyan_Series_Tone_Negative_001.wav
  I'll endure it.

Series_HittedLast__VO_Daiyan_Series_Tone_Positive_010.wav
  Are you okay?

  The end.

  Even if the strings are cut, the sound will not stop. Let's do our best next time.

Series_Skill01__VO_Daiyan_Single_Skill_001.wav
  If you're lying down, you're a instrument. If you're standing, you're a weapon!

  2 Up Newton

Series_Ultimate__VO_Daiyan_Single_Ultimate_SSR_001.wav
  This is the end!

Series_Up_002.wav
  We need an adjustment.

Series_Up_004.wav
  Step by step, steadily...

Series_Up_005.wav
  Yes, the sound has become smoother.

Series_Up_006.wav
  You must not let go of the strings.

Series_Up_007.wav
  The investigation is complete.

Series_Up_008.wav
  I'm getting inspired!

Series_Win__VO_Daiyan_Single_Win_001.wav
  That was a wonderful tactic, Commander. I shall now sing the song of victory.

Single_Acquire_R_001.wav
  When I was alone, Kosou was always by my side. It's as if he understood my thoughts. It's strange. Come to think of it, it's been a year since I met the Commander. There's another person who understands me.

Single_Acquire_SSR_001.wav
  I've realized that you're like a fog. Fog is a material of the ancient. It doesn't hurt even when hit by wind or sunlight. It doesn't hurt even when it rains or gets muddy. It's a very strong... Oh, no, I didn't mean to say that you're a Bokunenjin.

Single_Anniversary_001.wav
  After spending a year together, I made a new song to commemorate the first year. If you don't mind, can you be my first recipient?

Single_Birthday_R_001.wav
  Happy birthday, Commander. Speaking of human birthdays, it's the day when close friends gather to sing birthday songs, right? Then, how about I play the music and the others sing?

Single_Birthday_SSR_001.wav
  Songs are divided into many phrases, but life is also a story. Commander, happy birthday!

Single_Birthday_SSR_002.wav
  Commander, happy birthday. I've prepared a chouju mask for you. I heard that humans celebrate their partner's birthday with this mask. And I also made a bracelet. If you don't mind, shall we put it on now?

Single_Children_001.wav
  Commander, I was invited by the children to hold a dance party for the military. Do you know a song that suits the children? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

Single_Christmas_001.wav
  Ah, I'm sorry. I was going to be Santa today, but I didn't have a costume that fit my size... I'll bring the surprise to Laina again. Merry Christmas, Commander.

Single_Christmas_002.wav
  Merry Christmas, Commander. Did you like our surprise? ... You have a strange expression. Was it that strange to play a Christmas song in your own voice?

Single_Duanwu_001.wav
  I sent a lot of pictures of Chimaki to everyone to choose from. The one that's thin and a little dented in the middle is... I think it was a beautiful Chimaki, right?

Single_Friendliness_001.wav
  Commander, do you need any help?

Single_Friendliness_002.wav
  There is a thousand years of history in the ancient

Single_Friendliness_003.wav
  Human fingers are very soft, so if you don't use a gauze, you'll easily get hurt. ...This is good. Well then, shall we play the strings, Commander?

Single_Friendliness_004.wav
  I'm familiar with the atmosphere of the Hermes, and it's very nostalgic. Is it because the Commander is here?

Single_Friendliness_005.wav
  Is it varios polytopova? Yes, so many ideas handy.... I have described to you Just to increase in discourse, but I'll go to the details, and for today I'll just record your kolil

Single_Friendliness_006.wav
  Even if it's just for a moment, if my music can soothe someone, that's enough. Was it a little blue?

Single_Friendliness_007.wav
  I want to understand more about human emotions and thoughts. If I do that, I can make a song that is more attractive and can be more sympathized with by someone. Commander, can you help me?

Single_Friendliness_008.wav
  Commander, are you free right now? I want to talk to you for a bit. Whenever I talk to you, I always get inspired.

Single_Friendliness_009.wav
  Um, Commander... Do you want to hear my new song? Ah, no, it's nothing... I've been nervous lately when I'm with you, Commander.

Single_Friendliness_010.wav
  Commander, I've sent you an email. My new song has been sent, so please wait! Please wait until I return to my room.

Single_Friendliness_011.wav
  I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable, but considering your safety in the contaminated area, why don't I write down your concerns?

Single_Friendliness_012.wav
  The parting of a moment is for the sake of being together for a longer time in the future. Commander, I'm glad that you have the same thoughts. If this is the case, wherever you are, you will feel Commander by your side.

Single_Friendliness_013.wav
  The future I long for is only as long as I have you with me, Commander.

Single_Login_001.wav
  What song are you going to play today?

Single_MidAutumn_001.wav
  In the music that Meirin-san gave me, there was a song called Heiko Shugetsu, which was perfect for tonight. Commander, would you like to watch it with me?

Single_MidAutumn_002.wav
  Commander, I've prepared a moon cake for tonight's moon viewing. Yes, I'm sure you'll like it. The taste? That's something to look forward to after you've eaten it.

Single_NewYear_001.wav
  Commander, are you free after work? I want to have all the time after this. Today is an important day, so I want to spend it with you. Um... Can I be alone?

Single_NewYear_002.wav
  I hope you can spend the new year in peace and health. I'm very happy to spend today with you.

Single_Obon_001.wav
  People were seeking ways to send their feelings to places they could not reach. To tell people that they can no longer meet, to tell them what they have been told. So, in order to not have regrets, we must cherish the present.

Single_Obtain_R_001__VO_Daiyan_Single_Obtain_SSR_001.wav
  I'm looking forward to what kind of song will be born in the reunion with you.

Single_Passive_SSR_001.wav
  End

Single_SpringFes_001.wav
  I wish for the new year to be filled with the health of the Commander and the wishes of everyone. Me? Hmm... If the God of Ideas will accept it, that will be enough.

  Happy New Year. This year's Elmo is also very lively. I have already given you a year's worth of money. I will secretly give you your share later.

Single_Valentine_001.wav
  As expected, the Commander's room is overflowing with chocolates. However, it seems that my choice of present was not wrong. Huh? That face... Did I ruin the mood?

Single_Valentine_002.wav
  Commander, this is... Yes, it's chocolate. It's not something I gave to the Kou, it's a handmade chocolate for you. Did you get what I meant?

Single_WhiteVale_001.wav
  Is this... Is it really okay to receive such a valuable music score? Thank you very much, Commander. If you can play it, I'll let you know right away.
