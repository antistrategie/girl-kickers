  Commander, have you seen Meiling's collection? Hey, what are you hiding behind your back?

VO_Groza_12_VO_Groza_Series_Daily_007.wav
  Mission start, let's go. Don't worry, I'll return them all safely.

  ... Ah... Ah... It's not the Commander... I... I just... No, there's no problem with the system.

VO_Groza_14_VO_Groza_Series_Daily_009.wav
  The balance of this month's savings is well balanced. I'm relieved. This will make you feel better, Commander.

  Oh?

VO_Groza_32_VO_Groza_Single_Acquire_R_001.wav
  It's been a year in a blink of an eye. Thanks to you, Commander, it's been a year full of joy. Let's continue to walk together, Commander.

VO_Groza_33_VO_Groza_Single_Acquire_SR_001.wav
  Commander, I have a lot to tell you over the past year. If I try to say it, I'm always being controlled by someone. But this feeling doesn't change. From now on, no matter what decision you make, I believe in you. I swear I'll always be by your side.

VO_Groza_34_VO_Groza_Single_Acquire_SSR_001.wav
  Another year? I'm grateful for your support throughout the year, Commander.

VO_Groza_35_VO_Groza_Single_Anniversary_001.wav
  Without your guidance, I wouldn't have been able to accomplish such a difficult mission. I can't measure your contribution. Hm? You're exaggerating? Then... Thank you for the past year, Commander.

VO_Groza_36_VO_Groza_Single_Birthday_R_001.wav
  Happy birthday. Today is a special day, so you have to relax. Leave all your work to me, Commander.

VO_Groza_37_VO_Groza_Single_Birthday_SR_001.wav
  Commander, happy birthday. Whatever you do today, you will be forgiven. Well then, first, have my special birthday dinner.

VO_Groza_38_VO_Groza_Single_Birthday_SSR_001.wav
  Birthday? I can't believe today is your birthday. It's been a while. How are you feeling? Me? Of course, no problem. Happy birthday, Commander.

VO_Groza_39_VO_Groza_Single_Children_001.wav
  Work is important, but it's not bad to relax on a day like this. Oh, it seems that Helena has some candy left over. Commander, would you like one?

VO_Groza_40_VO_Groza_Single_Christmas_001.wav
  Merry Christmas, Commander. Be careful, it's cold at night. I made two Santa hats. They're both made of cedar. One for Meilin, and the other for Commander. It's my responsibility as the captain to keep you healthy.

VO_Groza_41_VO_Groza_Single_Duanwu_001.wav
  Commander, this sashay is like a talisman, but it has a power like a talisman. Please accept it. Eh? The string of the talisman is really flashy. This is the tradition of the word theory, Commander. By doing this, you will avoid danger.

VO_Groza_42_VO_Groza_Single_Friendliness_001.wav
  Hm? It's not a nuisance. So, what do you order, Commander?

VO_Groza_43_VO_Groza_Single_Friendliness_002.wav
  Let me guess. That face. You had some trouble. Eh? I did the same thing before?

VO_Groza_44_VO_Groza_Single_Friendliness_003.wav
  New strategy report? I've already organized it. Do you want to check it now? That's right. So far, everything is fine. You can rest after the meeting, Commander.

VO_Groza_45_VO_Groza_Single_Friendliness_004.wav
  If you're working late at night, you should eat something high in calories. This cake is just... It's okay. This time, it's the recipe.

VO_Groza_46_VO_Groza_Single_Friendliness_005.wav
  This? I've made a new cooking cloth. I hope it will add more depth to the taste.

VO_Groza_47_VO_Groza_Single_Friendliness_006.wav
  Night is a precious time to be able to focus on yourself. Of course, it's not bad to spend time with the Commander.

VO_Groza_48_VO_Groza_Single_Friendliness_007.wav
  Commander, I've been studying how to make chocolate cakes lately, and they're pretty good. I guarantee that the taste is Meiling's. Commander, try some.

VO_Groza_49_VO_Groza_Single_Friendliness_008.wav
  Have you ever eaten sushi? I've been thinking about trying it out lately, but Meirin says the fresh rice smells really good. I've already prepared the costumes you'll need to hold the sushi. Commander, please look forward to it.

VO_Groza_50_VO_Groza_Single_Friendliness_009.wav
  The temperature last night was a warm, warm, warm temperature. From the Commander's point of view, it's a temperature that feels cold. Commander, are you able to prevent the ship from being damaged? A new muffler has arrived. It's in the command room. Just in case, when the temperature drops at night, I'll call you to wear it.

VO_Groza_51_VO_Groza_Single_Friendliness_010.wav
  Commander, you look tired. Would you like to lie down for a bit? Eh? You want me to stay by your side? Sure. I'll prepare some warm tea for you when you wake up.

VO_Groza_52_VO_Groza_Single_Friendliness_011.wav
  You're relying on me? Thank you, Commander. You're the best compliment for me.

VO_Groza_53_VO_Groza_Single_Friendliness_012.wav
  I'm so honored to have your trust. I don't mind relying on you from now on, Commander.

VO_Groza_54_VO_Groza_Single_Friendliness_013.wav
  Me? You already knew what I wanted, right? Since I joined the team, you gave me everything I needed. Now I just wish for this peace to last forever.

VO_Groza_58_VO_Groza_Single_MidAutumn_001.wav
  I added a new tower to the mobile base. Did you notice, Commander? I made it with everyone. How about tonight, Commander? Why don't you make a nice tower with us?

VO_Groza_59_VO_Groza_Single_NewYear_001.wav
  Happy New Year, Commander. How about a Mechoo this year? Drinking it on a cold night will warm you up. Don't worry. I have 14 Mechoo that I reserved at the Bordeaux Nizza two weeks ago. I'll leave them in the command room. Maylene is happy too.

VO_Groza_60_VO_Groza_Single_Obtain_R_001.wav
  Did you get into a difficult problem? I'll gladly cooperate, Commander.

VO_Groza_61_VO_Groza_Single_Obtain_SR_001.wav
  Everything is in the plan. As long as I'm here, no need to worry.

VO_Groza_62_VO_Groza_Single_Obtain_SSR_001.wav
  I appreciate your support at the right time, Commander.

VO_Groza_63_VO_Groza_Series_Skill01__VO_Groza_Single_Skill_001.wav

  You're going to rebel?

VO_Groza_65_VO_Groza_Single_SpringFes_001.wav
  The one on the window? I see, Commander. According to Merlin, if you paste the letters upside down, it will bring good luck for a year.

VO_Groza_66_VO_Groza_Single_ThanksGiving_001.wav
  Commander, today's plan is to improve the quality of the food at the orbit base. Turkey... It's the protein I finally got after all the hard work. Thank you for always being by my side for a year, Commander.

  Hazelnut chocolate... Maybe I can tell you... Oh, Commander. Did you receive the present? I made that chocolate over time. It's not that difficult because it's origami, but... Happy Valentine's Day, Commander.

  Today's task is not over yet. Commander, do you need to confirm progress?

VO_Groza_8_VO_Groza_Series_Daily_003.wav
  ...That's... ...Carolick and... ...Remesis... ...Phew... At least, I want them to be quiet during the night.

VO_Groza_9_VO_Groza_Series_Daily_004.wav
  Commander, check the plan for this operation. No matter how easy the mission is, you can't let your guard down.
