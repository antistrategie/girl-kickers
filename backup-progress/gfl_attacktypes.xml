<!-- XCR SHARKRY, THE STANDARD OF ALL ASSAULT RIFLE ATTACK TYPES -->
<!-- Note: I am not the most hardcore Sharkry simp, but I chose her to be the standard of all longarm type signature weapons because she runs an AR-15 style format rifle chambered in a very common round. Sharkry is never depicted as too exceptional in combat yet she is shown to be able to hold her own in missions with Dolls that have more combat experience with her, namely Makiatto, Springfield and Centaureissi, which makes her a perfect candidate to have most of the dolls based on. -->
	
	<!-- Attack Type ranges will be usually divided into Near (Under 8m), Close (Under 16m), Med (Under 28m) , Far (under 52m), Ext (beyond 52m). This is to help coincide with scope effectiveness. Take note that engagements that happen at Ext ranges are ultra rare, but they do exist.-->
